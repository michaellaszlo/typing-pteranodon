- aesthetic improvements
  - mark and blur the bottom of the chute
    - mark the threshold with a distinct line
    - blur the portion below the line so that the word remains somewhat visible
  - blur the top of the chute with a gradient
  - add arrows for best and current runs
- gameplay improvements
  + pause between levels
  + make each level longer than the last
  - enable faster progression for fast typers? (by beating the midway point?)
  - reduce the chute height so that word speed doesn't become excessive?
- restart without reload
  - keys to restart quickly at end of game
  - button to start game at any time
- effects
  - failure: typo
  - failure: incomplete
  - completion: word
  - completion: level
- typing speed
  - current
  - recent
  - average in a window of recent runs
  - graph of average over time (smoothed by a window)
- key statistics
  - speed
  - accuracy
  - which wrong key
  - per character
  - per bigram
  - per finger
- game modes
  - character on key
  - character falling in column
  - character running across row
  - whole word falling through the chute
  - whole sentences running across the chute
- hazard warning
  - highlight key combinations where you frequently trip up
- evil mode
  - a word suffix can change, forcing you to backspace and retype
- targeted training

    - corpora
  - analysis
    - over time
    - by key, character, bigram, finger
    - accuracy and speed
      -> fastest bigram? most accurate bigram?
  - training
    - drills on keys, characters, bigrams, fingers
    - special levels filled with drill sequences
  - achievements
    - badges for all kinds of statistical achievements
      -> including consistent usage

- how do we generate levels?
  - corpus excerpts
  - synthetic words

- tournament mode
  - generate the same levels for a group of contestants

- teacher mode
  - the teacher can monitor students' progress and administer tests

- paid accounts
  - more features, more statistics, remotely stored history

- sway
  + keep swinging rate constant while chute speed increases
    -> otherwise it becomes difficult and nauseating to read the word
  - vary the sway parameters
  - introduce various types of sway
    + sine
    - square
    - squarish
    - sawtooth
    - swing
  - precompute all images for performance and to calculate vertical bounds
    - can we ensure that the top edge falls monotonically?

- test with various browsers
  - hide cursor on IE

- precalculate trig functions
- use a shim for requestAnimationFrame

- consider other performance tips

guiding principles:
- accurate typing
  - one strike and you're out
  - dissuade use of the backspace
  - allowing yourself to use the backspace causes much time to be lost
    - time to recognize the error
    - time to backspace
    - time to retype
    - it would be faster to type it correctly the first time
  - stop rushing ahead and making errors
  - slow down when you're unsure
  - pause to contemplate the next key
  - gradually the pause will grow shorter
  - speed will increase as you maintain high accuracy
- gamification
  - fun to play
  - interesting visual effects
  - varied mechanics
  - incentives to do better
  - level up: more challenges, different visuals, higher score
- help the user associate characters with finger movements
  - character per key
  - characters per row
  - characters per column
  - word
  - sentence
- diagnose weaknesses
  - detailed statistics
  - per finger
  - per character
  - per bigram
  - option to train on weaknesses instead of general text
- maintain a historical record
  - administer general typing test
    - focusing on weaknesses
    - focusing on general text
  - detailed statistics and general typing speed
- localization
  - choice of general text
    - public-domain fiction
    - programming language
    - quotes from current fiction?
    - non-fiction?
    - foreign languages?
  - alternative keyboard layouts?
