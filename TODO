- history
  - longest run
  - recent runs
- mark and blur the bottom of the chute
  - mark the threshold with a distinct line
  - blur the portion below the line so that the word remains somewhat visible
- blur the top of the chute with a gradient
- make each level longer than the last? (Fibonacci?)
- enable faster progression for fast typers? (for beating the midway point?)
- reduce the chute height so that word speed doesn't become excessive?
- restart without reload
  - keys to restart quickly at end of game
  - button to start game at any time
- effects
  - failure: typo
  - failure: incomplete
  - completion: word
  - completion: level
- typing speed
  - current
  - recent
  - average in a window of recent runs
  - graph of average over time (smoothed by a window)
- key statistics
  - speed
  - accuracy
  - which wrong key
  - per character
  - per bigram

  - whole sentences running across the chute
- hazard warning
  - highlight key combinations where you frequently trip up
- evil mode
  - a word suffix can change, forcing you to backspace and retype
- targeted training
  - choose a game mode

- sway
  + keep swinging rate constant while chute speed increases
    -> otherwise it becomes difficult and nauseating to read the word
  - vary the sway parameters
  - introduce various types of sway
    + sine
    - square
    - squarish
    - sawtooth
    - swing

  - insects
  - birds
  - pteranodon
- achievements
  - tiers of badges for all kinds of statistics

- test with various browsers
  - hide cursor on IE

- precalculate trig functions
- use a shim for requestAnimationFrame

- consider other performance tips
  http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/

guiding principles:
- accurate typing
  - one strike and you're out
  - dissuade use of the backspace
  - allowing yourself to use the backspace causes much time to be lost
    - time to recognize the error
    - time to backspace
    - time to retype
    - it would be faster to type it correctly the first time
  - stop rushing ahead and making errors
  - slow down when you're unsure
  - pause to contemplate the next key
  - gradually the pause will grow shorter
  - speed will increase as you maintain high accuracy
- gamification
  - fun to play
  - interesting visual effects
  - varied mechanics
  - incentives to do better
  - level up: more challenges, different visuals, higher score
- help the user associate characters with finger movements
  - character per key
  - characters per row
  - characters per column
  - word
  - sentence
- diagnose weaknesses
  - detailed statistics
  - per finger
  - per character
  - per bigram
  - option to train on weaknesses instead of general text
- maintain a historical record
  - administer general typing test
    - focusing on weaknesses
    - focusing on general text
  - detailed statistics and general typing speed
- localization
  - choice of general text
    - public-domain fiction
    - programming language
    - quotes from current fiction?
    - non-fiction?
    - foreign languages?
  - alternative keyboard layouts?
