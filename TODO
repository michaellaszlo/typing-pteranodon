- restart button
- some kind of score
- calculate animations with absolute time

- improve game layout
- improve refocusing
- test with IE

- precalculate trig functions
- use a shim for requestAnimationFrame

- consider other performance tips

guiding principles:
- accurate typing
  - one strike and you're out
  - dissuade use of the backspace
  - allowing yourself to use the backspace causes much time to be lost
    - time to recognize the error
    - time to backspace
    - time to retype
    - it would be faster to type it correctly the first time
  - stop rushing ahead and making errors
  - slow down when you're unsure
  - pause to contemplate the next key
  - after a while, finding the right key will become second nature
- gamification
  - fun to play
  - interesting visual effects
  - varied mechanics
  - incentives to do better
  - level up: more challenges, different visuals, higher score
- help the user associate characters with finger movements
  - character per key
  - characters per row
  - characters per column
  - word
  - sentence
- diagnose weaknesses
  - detailed statistics
  - per finger
  - per character
  - per bigram
  - option to train on weaknesses instead of general text
- maintain a historical record
  - administer general typing test
    - focusing on weaknesses
    - focusing on general text
  - detailed statistics and general typing speed
- localization
  - choice of general text
    - public-domain fiction
    - programming language
    - quotes from current fiction?
    - non-fiction?
    - foreign languages?
  - alternative keyboard layouts?
