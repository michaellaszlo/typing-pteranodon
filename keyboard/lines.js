lines.push('CHAPTER I. Mrs. Stevens is Frightened');
lines.push('In the drowsy heat of the summer afternoon the Red House was taking its');
lines.push('siesta. There was a lazy murmur of bees in the flower-borders, a gentle');
lines.push('cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms. From distant lawns came');
lines.push('the whir of a mowing-machine, that most restful of all country sounds;');
lines.push('making ease the sweeter in that it is taken while others are working.');
lines.push('It was the hour when even those whose business it is to attend to');
lines.push('the wants of others have a moment or two for themselves. In the');
lines.push('housekeeper\'s room Audrey Stevens, the pretty parlour-maid, re-trimmed');
lines.push('her best hat, and talked idly to her aunt, the cook-housekeeper of Mr.');
lines.push('Mark Ablett\'s bachelor home.');
lines.push('"For Joe?" said Mrs. Stevens placidly, her eye on the hat. Audrey');
lines.push('nodded. She took a pin from her mouth, found a place in the hat for it,');
lines.push('and said, "He likes a bit of pink."');
lines.push('"I don\'t say I mind a bit of pink myself," said her aunt. "Joe Turner');
lines.push('isn\'t the only one."');
lines.push('"It isn\'t everybody\'s colour," said Audrey, holding the hat out at arm\'s');
lines.push('length, and regarding it thoughtfully. "Stylish, isn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"Oh, it\'ll suit you all right, and it would have suited me at your');
lines.push('age. A bit too dressy for me now, though wearing better than some other');
lines.push('people, I daresay. I was never the one to pretend to be what I wasn\'t.');
lines.push('If I\'m fifty-five, I\'m fifty-five--that\'s what I say."');
lines.push('"Fifty-eight, isn\'t it, auntie?"');
lines.push('"I was just giving that as an example," said Mrs. Stevens with great');
lines.push('dignity.');
lines.push('Audrey threaded a needle, held her hand out and looked at her nails');
lines.push('critically for a moment, and then began to sew.');
lines.push('"Funny thing that about Mr. Mark\'s brother. Fancy not seeing your');
lines.push('brother for fifteen years." She gave a self-conscious laugh and went on,');
lines.push('"Wonder what I should do if I didn\'t see Joe for fifteen years."');
lines.push('"As I told you all this morning," said her aunt, "I\'ve been here five');
lines.push('years, and never heard of a brother. I could say that before everybody');
lines.push('if I was going to die to-morrow. There\'s been no brother here while I\'ve');
lines.push('been here."');
lines.push('"You could have knocked me down with a feather when he spoke about him');
lines.push('at breakfast this morning. I didn\'t hear what went before, naturally,');
lines.push('but they was all talking about the brother when I went in--now what');
lines.push('was it I went in for--hot milk, was it, or toast?--well, they was');
lines.push('all talking, and Mr. Mark turns to me, and says--you know his');
lines.push('way--\'Stevens,\' he says, \'my brother is coming to see me this afternoon;');
lines.push('I\'m expecting him about three,\' he says. \'Show him into the office,\' he');
lines.push('says, just like that. \'Yes, sir,\' I says quite quietly, but I was never');
lines.push('so surprised in my life, not knowing he had a brother. \'My brother from');
lines.push('Australia,\' he says--there, I\'d forgotten that. From Australia."');
lines.push('"Well, he may have been in Australia," said Mrs. Stevens, judicially; "I');
lines.push('can\'t say for that, not knowing the country; but what I do say is he\'s');
lines.push('never been here. Not while I\'ve been here, and that\'s five years."');
lines.push('"Well, but, auntie, he hasn\'t been here for fifteen years. I heard Mr.');
lines.push('Mark telling Mr. Cayley. \'Fifteen years,\' he says. Mr. Cayley having');
lines.push('arst him when his brother was last in England. Mr. Cayley knew of him,');
lines.push('I heard him telling Mr. Beverley, but didn\'t know when he was last in');
lines.push('England--see? So that\'s why he arst Mr. Mark."');
lines.push('"I\'m not saying anything about fifteen years, Audrey. I can only speak');
lines.push('for what I know, and that\'s five years Whitsuntide. I can take my oath');
lines.push('he\'s not set foot in the house since five years Whitsuntide. And if he\'s');
lines.push('been in Australia, as you say, well, I daresay he\'s had his reasons."');
lines.push('"What reasons?" said Audrey lightly.');
lines.push('"Never mind what reasons. Being in the place of a mother to you, since');
lines.push('your poor mother died, I say this, Audrey--when a gentleman goes to');
lines.push('Australia, he has his reasons. And when he stays in Australia fifteen');
lines.push('years, as Mr. Mark says, and as I know for myself for five years, he');
lines.push('has his reasons. And a respectably brought-up girl doesn\'t ask what');
lines.push('reasons."');
lines.push('"Got into trouble, I suppose," said Audrey carelessly. "They were saying');
lines.push('at breakfast he\'d been a wild one. Debts. I\'m glad Joe isn\'t like that.');
lines.push('He\'s got fifteen pounds in the post-office savings\' bank. Did I tell');
lines.push('you?"');
lines.push('But there was not to be any more talk of Joe Turner that afternoon. The');
lines.push('ringing of a bell brought Audrey to her feet--no longer Audrey, but now');
lines.push('Stevens. She arranged her cap in front of the glass.');
lines.push('"There, that\'s the front door," she said. "That\'s him. \'Show him into');
lines.push('the office,\' said Mr. Mark. I suppose he doesn\'t want the other');
lines.push('ladies and gentlemen to see him. Well, they\'re all out at their golf,');
lines.push('anyhow--Wonder if he\'s going to stay--P\'raps he\'s brought back a lot of');
lines.push('gold from Australia--I might hear something about Australia, because if');
lines.push('anybody can get gold there, then I don\'t say but what Joe and I--"');
lines.push('"Now, now, get on, Audrey."');
lines.push('"Just going, darling." She went out.');
lines.push('To anyone who had just walked down the drive in the August sun, the open');
lines.push('door of the Red House revealed a delightfully inviting hall, of which');
lines.push('even the mere sight was cooling. It was a big low-roofed,');
lines.push('oak-beamed place, with cream-washed walls and diamond-paned windows,');
lines.push('blue-curtained. On the right and left were doors leading into other');
lines.push('living-rooms, but on the side which faced you as you came in were');
lines.push('windows again, looking on to a small grass court, and from open windows');
lines.push('to open windows such air as there was played gently. The staircase went');
lines.push('up in broad, low steps along the right-hand wall, and, turning to the');
lines.push('left, led you along a gallery, which ran across the width of the hall,');
lines.push('to your bedroom. That is, if you were going to stay the night. Mr.');
lines.push('Robert Ablett\'s intentions in this matter were as yet unknown.');
lines.push('As Audrey came across the hall she gave a little start as she saw Mr.');
lines.push('Cayley suddenly, sitting unobtrusively in a seat beneath one of the');
lines.push('front windows, reading. No reason why he shouldn\'t be there; certainly');
lines.push('a much cooler place than the golf-links on such a day; but somehow there');
lines.push('was a deserted air about the house that afternoon, as if all the guests');
lines.push('were outside, or--perhaps the wisest place of all--up in their bedrooms,');
lines.push('sleeping. Mr. Cayley, the master\'s cousin, was a surprise; and, having');
lines.push('given a little exclamation as she came suddenly upon him, she blushed,');
lines.push('and said, "Oh, I beg your pardon, sir, I didn\'t see you at first," and');
lines.push('he looked up from his book and smiled at her. An attractive smile it was');
lines.push('on that big ugly face. "Such a gentleman, Mr. Cayley," she thought to');
lines.push('herself as she went on, and wondered what the master would do without');
lines.push('him. If this brother, for instance, had to be bundled back to Australia,');
lines.push('it was Mr. Cayley who would do most of the bundling.');
lines.push('"So this is Mr. Robert," said Audrey to herself, as she came in sight of');
lines.push('the visitor.');
lines.push('She told her aunt afterwards that she would have known him anywhere for');
lines.push('Mr. Mark\'s brother, but she would have said that in any event. Actually');
lines.push('she was surprised. Dapper little Mark, with his neat pointed beard and');
lines.push('his carefully curled moustache; with his quick-darting eyes, always');
lines.push('moving from one to the other of any company he was in, to register');
lines.push('one more smile to his credit when he had said a good thing, one more');
lines.push('expectant look when he was only waiting his turn to say it; he was');
lines.push('a very different man from this rough-looking, ill-dressed colonial,');
lines.push('staring at her so loweringly.');
lines.push('"I want to see Mr. Mark Ablett," he growled. It sounded almost like a');
lines.push('threat.');
lines.push('Audrey recovered herself and smiled reassuringly at him. She had a smile');
lines.push('for everybody.');
lines.push('"Yes, sir. He is expecting you, if you will come this way."');
lines.push('"Oh! So you know who I am, eh?"');
lines.push('"Mr. Robert Ablett?"');
lines.push('"Ay, that\'s right. So he\'s expecting me, eh? He\'ll be glad to see me,');
lines.push('eh?"');
lines.push('"If you will come this way, sir," said Audrey primly.');
lines.push('She went to the second door on the left, and opened it.');
lines.push('"Mr. Robert Ab--" she began, and then broke off. The room was empty. She');
lines.push('turned to the man behind her. "If you will sit down, sir, I will find');
lines.push('the master. I know he\'s in, because he told me that you were coming this');
lines.push('afternoon."');
lines.push('"Oh!" He looked round the room. "What d\'you call this place, eh?"');
lines.push('"The office, sir."');
lines.push('"The office?"');
lines.push('"The room where the master works, sir."');
lines.push('"Works, eh? That\'s new. Didn\'t know he\'d ever done a stroke of work in');
lines.push('his life."');
lines.push('"Where he writes, sir," said Audrey, with dignity. The fact that Mr.');
lines.push('Mark "wrote," though nobody knew what, was a matter of pride in the');
lines.push('housekeeper\'s room.');
lines.push('"Not well-dressed enough for the drawing-room, eh?"');
lines.push('"I will tell the master you are here, sir," said Audrey decisively.');
lines.push('She closed the door and left him there.');
lines.push('Well! Here was something to tell auntie! Her mind was busy at once,');
lines.push('going over all the things which he had said to her and she had said to');
lines.push('him--quiet-like. "Directly I saw him I said to myself--" Why, you could');
lines.push('have knocked her over with a feather. Feathers, indeed, were a perpetual');
lines.push('menace to Audrey.');
lines.push('However, the immediate business was to find the master. She walked');
lines.push('across the hall to the library, glanced in, came back a little');
lines.push('uncertainly, and stood in front of Cayley.');
lines.push('"If you please, sir," she said in a low, respectful voice, "can you tell');
lines.push('me where the master is? It\'s Mr. Robert called."');
lines.push('"What?" said Cayley, looking up from his book. "Who?"');
lines.push('Audrey repeated her question.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know. Isn\'t he in the office? He went up to the Temple after');
lines.push('lunch. I don\'t think I\'ve seen him since."');
lines.push('"Thank you, sir. I will go up to the Temple."');
lines.push('Cayley returned to his book.');
lines.push('The "Temple" was a brick summer-house, in the gardens at the back of');
lines.push('the house, about three hundred yards away. Here Mark meditated sometimes');
lines.push('before retiring to the "office" to put his thoughts upon paper. The');
lines.push('thoughts were not of any great value; moreover, they were given off at');
lines.push('the dinner-table more often than they got on to paper, and got on to');
lines.push('paper more often than they got into print. But that did not prevent');
lines.push('the master of The Red House from being a little pained when a visitor');
lines.push('treated the Temple carelessly, as if it had been erected for the');
lines.push('ordinary purposes of flirtation and cigarette-smoking. There had been an');
lines.push('occasion when two of his guests had been found playing fives in it. Mark');
lines.push('had said nothing at the time, save to ask with a little less than his');
lines.push('usual point--whether they couldn\'t find anywhere else for their game,');
lines.push('but the offenders were never asked to The Red House again.');
lines.push('Audrey walked slowly up to the Temple, looked in and walked slowly back.');
lines.push('All that walk for nothing. Perhaps the master was upstairs in his room.');
lines.push('"Not well-dressed enough for the drawing-room." Well, now, Auntie, would');
lines.push('you like anyone in your drawing-room with a red handkerchief round his');
lines.push('neck and great big dusty boots, and--listen! One of the men shooting');
lines.push('rabbits. Auntie was partial to a nice rabbit, and onion sauce. How hot');
lines.push('it was; she wouldn\'t say no to a cup of tea. Well, one thing, Mr. Robert');
lines.push('wasn\'t staying the night; he hadn\'t any luggage. Of course Mr. Mark');
lines.push('could lend him things; he had clothes enough for six. She would have');
lines.push('known him anywhere for Mr. Mark\'s brother.');
lines.push('She came into the house. As she passed the housekeeper\'s room on her');
lines.push('way to the hall, the door opened suddenly, and a rather frightened face');
lines.push('looked out.');
lines.push('"Hallo, Aud," said Elsie. "It\'s Audrey," she said, turning into the');
lines.push('room.');
lines.push('"Come in, Audrey," called Mrs. Stevens.');
lines.push('"What\'s up?" said Audrey, looking in at the door.');
lines.push('"Oh, my dear, you gave me such a turn. Where have you been?"');
lines.push('"Up to the Temple."');
lines.push('"Did you hear anything?"');
lines.push('"Hear what?"');
lines.push('"Bangs and explosions and terrible things."');
lines.push('"Oh!" said Audrey, rather relieved. "One of the men shooting rabbits.');
lines.push('Why, I said to myself as I came along, \'Auntie\'s partial to a nice');
lines.push('rabbit,\' I said, and I shouldn\'t be surprised if--"');
lines.push('"Rabbits!" said her aunt scornfully. "It was inside the house, my girl."');
lines.push('"Straight it was," said Elsie. She was one of the housemaids. "I said to');
lines.push('Mrs. Stevens--didn\'t I, Mrs. Stevens?--\'That was in the house,\' I said."');
lines.push('Audrey looked at her aunt and then at Elsie.');
lines.push('"Do you think he had a revolver with him?" she said in a hushed voice.');
lines.push('"Who?" said Elsie excitedly.');
lines.push('"That brother of his. From Australia. I said as soon as I set eyes on');
lines.push('him, \'You\'re a bad lot, my man!\' That\'s what I said, Elsie. Even before');
lines.push('he spoke to me. Rude!" She turned to her aunt. "Well, I give you my');
lines.push('word."');
lines.push('"If you remember, Audrey, I always said there was no saying with anyone');
lines.push('from Australia." Mrs. Stevens lay back in her chair, breathing rather');
lines.push('rapidly. "I wouldn\'t go out of this room now, not if you paid me a');
lines.push('hundred thousand pounds."');
lines.push('"Oh, Mrs. Stevens!" said Elsie, who badly wanted five shillings for a');
lines.push('new pair of shoes, "I wouldn\'t go as far as that, not myself, but--"');
lines.push('"There!" cried Mrs. Stevens, sitting up with a start. They listened');
lines.push('anxiously, the two girls instinctively coming closer to the older');
lines.push('woman\'s chair.');
lines.push('A door was being shaken, kicked, rattled.');
lines.push('"Listen!"');
lines.push('Audrey and Elsie looked at each other with frightened eyes.');
lines.push('They heard a man\'s voice, loud, angry.');
lines.push('"Open the door!" it was shouting. "Open the door! I say, open the door!"');
lines.push('"Don\'t open the door!" cried Mrs. Stevens in a panic, as if it was her');
lines.push('door which was threatened. "Audrey! Elsie! Don\'t let him in!"');
lines.push('"Damn it, open the door!" came the voice again.');
lines.push('"We\'re all going to be murdered in our beds," she quavered. Terrified,');
lines.push('the two girls huddled closer, and with an arm round each, Mrs. Stevens');
lines.push('sat there, waiting.');
lines.push('CHAPTER II. Mr. Gillingham Gets Out at the Wrong Station');
lines.push('Whether Mark Ablett was a bore or not depended on the point of view, but');
lines.push('it may be said at once that he never bored his company on the subject of');
lines.push('his early life. However, stories get about. There is always somebody');
lines.push('who knows. It was understood--and this, anyhow, on Mark\'s own');
lines.push('authority--that his father had been a country clergyman. It was said');
lines.push('that, as a boy, Mark had attracted the notice, and patronage, of some');
lines.push('rich old spinster of the neighbourhood, who had paid for his education,');
lines.push('both at school and university. At about the time when he was coming down');
lines.push('from Cambridge, his father had died; leaving behind him a few debts,');
lines.push('as a warning to his family, and a reputation for short sermons, as an');
lines.push('example to his successor. Neither warning nor example seems to have been');
lines.push('effective. Mark went to London, with an allowance from his patron, and');
lines.push('(it is generally agreed) made acquaintance with the money-lenders.');
lines.push('He was supposed, by his patron and any others who inquired, to be');
lines.push('"writing"; but what he wrote, other than letters asking for more time');
lines.push('to pay, has never been discovered. However, he attended the theatres');
lines.push('and music halls very regularly--no doubt with a view to some serious');
lines.push('articles in the "Spectator" on the decadence of the English stage.');
lines.push('Fortunately (from Mark\'s point of view) his patron died during his third');
lines.push('year in London, and left him all the money he wanted. From that moment');
lines.push('his life loses its legendary character, and becomes more a matter of');
lines.push('history. He settled accounts with the money-lenders, abandoned his');
lines.push('crop of wild oats to the harvesting of others, and became in his turn a');
lines.push('patron. He patronized the Arts. It was not only usurers who discovered');
lines.push('that Mark Ablett no longer wrote for money; editors were now offered');
lines.push('free contributions as well as free lunches; publishers were given');
lines.push('agreements for an occasional slender volume, in which the author paid');
lines.push('all expenses and waived all royalties; promising young painters and');
lines.push('poets dined with him; and he even took a theatrical company on tour,');
lines.push('playing host and "lead" with equal lavishness.');
lines.push('He was not what most people call a snob. A snob has been defined');
lines.push('carelessly as a man who loves a lord; and, more carefully, as a mean');
lines.push('lover of mean things--which would be a little unkind to the peerage if');
lines.push('the first definition were true. Mark had his vanities undoubtedly, but');
lines.push('he would sooner have met an actor-manager than an earl; he would have');
lines.push('spoken of his friendship with Dante--had that been possible--more glibly');
lines.push('than of his friendship with the Duke. Call him a snob if you like, but');
lines.push('not the worst kind of snob; a hanger-on, but to the skirts of Art, not');
lines.push('Society; a climber, but in the neighbourhood of Parnassus, not Hay Hill.');
lines.push('His patronage did not stop at the Arts. It also included Matthew Cayley,');
lines.push('a small cousin of thirteen, whose circumstances were as limited as had');
lines.push('been Mark\'s own before his patron had rescued him. He sent the Cayley');
lines.push('cousin to school and Cambridge. His motives, no doubt, were unworldly');
lines.push('enough at first; a mere repaying to his account in the Recording Angel\'s');
lines.push('book of the generosity which had been lavished on himself; a laying-up');
lines.push('of treasure in heaven. But it is probable that, as the boy grew up,');
lines.push('Mark\'s designs for his future were based on his own interests as much');
lines.push('as those of his cousin, and that a suitably educated Matthew Cayley of');
lines.push('twenty-three was felt by him to be a useful property for a man in his');
lines.push('position; a man, that is to say, whose vanities left him so little time');
lines.push('for his affairs.');
lines.push('Cayley, then, at twenty-three, looked after his cousin\'s affairs. By');
lines.push('this time Mark had bought the Red House and the considerable amount of');
lines.push('land which went with it. Cayley superintended the necessary staff.');
lines.push('His duties, indeed, were many. He was not quite secretary, not quite');
lines.push('land-agent, not quite business-adviser, not quite companion, but');
lines.push('something of all four. Mark leant upon him and called him "Cay,"');
lines.push('objecting quite rightly in the circumstances to the name of Matthew.');
lines.push('Cay, he felt was, above all, dependable; a big, heavy-jawed, solid');
lines.push('fellow, who didn\'t bother you with unnecessary talk--a boon to a man who');
lines.push('liked to do most of the talking himself.');
lines.push('Cayley was now twenty-eight, but had all the appearance of forty, which');
lines.push('was his patron\'s age. Spasmodically they entertained a good deal at the');
lines.push('Red House, and Mark\'s preference--call it kindliness or vanity, as');
lines.push('you please--was for guests who were not in a position to repay his');
lines.push('hospitality. Let us have a look at them as they came down to that');
lines.push('breakfast, of which Stevens, the parlour-maid, has already given us a');
lines.push('glimpse.');
lines.push('The first to appear was Major Rumbold, a tall, grey-haired,');
lines.push('grey-moustached, silent man, wearing a Norfolk coat and grey flannel');
lines.push('trousers, who lived on his retired pay and wrote natural history');
lines.push('articles for the papers. He inspected the dishes on the side-table,');
lines.push('decided carefully on kedgeree, and got to work on it. He had passed on');
lines.push('to a sausage by the time of the next arrival. This was Bill Beverly, a');
lines.push('cheerful young man in white flannel trousers and a blazer.');
lines.push('"Hallo, Major," he said as he came in, "how\'s the gout?"');
lines.push('"It isn\'t gout," said the Major gruffly.');
lines.push('"Well, whatever it is."');
lines.push('The Major grunted.');
lines.push('"I make a point of being polite at breakfast," said Bill, helping');
lines.push('himself largely to porridge. "Most people are so rude. That\'s why I');
lines.push('asked you. But don\'t tell me if it\'s a secret. Coffee?" he added, as he');
lines.push('poured himself out a cup.');
lines.push('"No, thanks. I never drink till I\'ve finished eating."');
lines.push('"Quite right, Major; it\'s only manners." He sat down opposite to the');
lines.push('other. "Well, we\'ve got a good day for our game. It\'s going to be dashed');
lines.push('hot, but that\'s where Betty and I score. On the fifth green, your old');
lines.push('wound, the one you got in that frontier skirmish in \'43, will begin to');
lines.push('trouble you; on the eighth, your liver, undermined by years of curry,');
lines.push('will drop to pieces; on the twelfth--"');
lines.push('"Oh, shut up, you ass!"');
lines.push('"Well, I\'m only warning you. Hallo; good morning, Miss Norris. I was');
lines.push('just telling the Major what was going to happen to you and him this');
lines.push('morning. Do you want any assistance, or do you prefer choosing your own');
lines.push('breakfast?"');
lines.push('"Please don\'t get up," said Miss Norris. "I\'ll help myself. Good');
lines.push('morning, Major." She smiled pleasantly at him. The Major nodded.');
lines.push('"Good morning. Going to be hot."');
lines.push('"As I was telling him," began Bill, "that\'s where--Hallo, here\'s Betty.');
lines.push('Morning, Cayley."');
lines.push('Betty Calladine and Cayley had come in together. Betty was the');
lines.push('eighteen-year-old daughter of Mrs. John Calladine, widow of the painter,');
lines.push('who was acting hostess on this occasion for Mark. Ruth Norris took');
lines.push('herself seriously as an actress and, on her holidays, seriously as a');
lines.push('golfer. She was quite competent as either. Neither the Stage Society nor');
lines.push('Sandwich had any terrors for her.');
lines.push('"By the way, the car will be round at 10.30," said Cayley, looking up');
lines.push('from his letters. "You\'re lunching there, and driving back directly');
lines.push('afterwards. Isn\'t that right?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t see why we shouldn\'t have--two rounds," said Bill hopefully.');
lines.push('"Much too hot in the afternoon," said the Major. "Get back comfortably');
lines.push('for tea."');
lines.push('Mark came in. He was generally the last. He greeted them and sat down to');
lines.push('toast and tea. Breakfast was not his meal. The others chattered gently');
lines.push('while he read his letters.');
lines.push('"Good God!" said Mark suddenly.');
lines.push('There was an instinctive turning of heads towards him. "I beg your');
lines.push('pardon, Miss Norris. Sorry, Betty."');
lines.push('Miss Norris smiled her forgiveness. She often wanted to say it herself,');
lines.push('particularly at rehearsals.');
lines.push('"I say, Cay!" He was frowning to himself--annoyed, puzzled. He held up a');
lines.push('letter and shook it. "Who do you think this is from?"');
lines.push('Cayley, at the other end of the table, shrugged his shoulders. How could');
lines.push('he possibly guess?');
lines.push('"Robert," said Mark.');
lines.push('"Robert?" It was difficult to surprise Cayley. "Well?"');
lines.push('"It\'s all very well to say \'well?\' like that," said Mark peevishly.');
lines.push('"He\'s coming here this afternoon."');
lines.push('"I thought he was in Australia, or somewhere."');
lines.push('"Of course. So did I." He looked across at Rumbold. "Got any brothers,');
lines.push('Major?"');
lines.push('"No."');
lines.push('"Well, take my advice, and don\'t have any."');
lines.push('"Not likely to now," said the Major.');
lines.push('Bill laughed. Miss Norris said politely: "But you haven\'t any brothers,');
lines.push('Mr. Ablett?"');
lines.push('"One," said Mark grimly. "If you\'re back in time you\'ll see him this');
lines.push('afternoon. He\'ll probably ask you to lend him five pounds. Don\'t."');
lines.push('Everybody felt a little uncomfortable.');
lines.push('"I\'ve got a brother," said Bill helpfully, "but I always borrow from');
lines.push('him."');
lines.push('"Like Robert," said Mark.');
lines.push('"When was he in England last?" asked Cayley.');
lines.push('"About fifteen years ago, wasn\'t it? You\'d have been a boy, of course."');
lines.push('"Yes, I remember seeing him once about then, but I didn\'t know if he had');
lines.push('been back since."');
lines.push('"No. Not to my knowledge." Mark, still obviously upset, returned to his');
lines.push('letter.');
lines.push('"Personally," said Bill, "I think relations are a great mistake."');
lines.push('"All the same," said Betty a little daringly, "it must be rather fun');
lines.push('having a skeleton in the cupboard."');
lines.push('Mark looked up, frowning.');
lines.push('"If you think it\'s fun, I\'ll hand him over to you, Betty. If he\'s');
lines.push('anything like he used to be, and like his few letters have been--well,');
lines.push('Cay knows."');
lines.push('Cayley grunted.');
lines.push('"All I knew was that one didn\'t ask questions about him."');
lines.push('It may have been meant as a hint to any too curious guest not to ask');
lines.push('more questions, or a reminder to his host not to talk too freely in');
lines.push('front of strangers, although he gave it the sound of a mere statement of');
lines.push('fact. But the subject dropped, to be succeeded by the more fascinating');
lines.push('one of the coming foursome. Mrs. Calladine was driving over with the');
lines.push('players in order to lunch with an old friend who lived near the links,');
lines.push('and Mark and Cayley were remaining at home--on affairs. Apparently');
lines.push('"affairs" were now to include a prodigal brother. But that need not make');
lines.push('the foursome less enjoyable.');
lines.push('At about the time when the Major (for whatever reasons) was fluffing');
lines.push('his tee-shot at the sixteenth, and Mark and his cousin were at their');
lines.push('business at the Red House, an attractive gentleman of the name of Antony');
lines.push('Gillingham was handing up his ticket at Woodham station and asking the');
lines.push('way to the village. Having received directions, he left his bag with the');
lines.push('station-master and walked off leisurely. He is an important person to');
lines.push('this story, so that it is as well we should know something about him');
lines.push('before letting him loose in it. Let us stop him at the top of the hill');
lines.push('on some excuse, and have a good look at him.');
lines.push('The first thing we realize is that he is doing more of the looking');
lines.push('than we are. Above a clean-cut, clean-shaven face, of the type usually');
lines.push('associated with the Navy, he carries a pair of grey eyes which seem');
lines.push('to be absorbing every detail of our person. To strangers this look is');
lines.push('almost alarming at first, until they discover that his mind is very');
lines.push('often elsewhere; that he has, so to speak, left his eyes on guard, while');
lines.push('he himself follows a train of thought in another direction. Many people');
lines.push('do this, of course; when, for instance, they are talking to one person');
lines.push('and trying to listen to another; but their eyes betray them. Antony\'s');
lines.push('never did.');
lines.push('He had seen a good deal of the world with those eyes, though never as a');
lines.push('sailor. When at the age of twenty-one he came into his mother\'s money,');
lines.push('400 pounds a year, old Gillingham looked up from the "Stockbreeders\'');
lines.push('Gazette" to ask what he was going to do.');
lines.push('"See the world," said Antony.');
lines.push('"Well, send me a line from America, or wherever you get to."');
lines.push('"Right," said Antony.');
lines.push('Old Gillingham returned to his paper. Antony was a younger son, and,');
lines.push('on the whole, not so interesting to his father as the cadets of certain');
lines.push('other families; Champion Birket\'s, for instance. But, then, Champion');
lines.push('Birket was the best Hereford bull he had ever bred.');
lines.push('Antony, however, had no intention of going further away than London. His');
lines.push('idea of seeing the world was to see, not countries, but people; and to');
lines.push('see them from as many angles as possible. There are all sorts in London');
lines.push('if you know how to look at them. So Antony looked at them--from');
lines.push('various strange corners; from the view-point of the valet, the');
lines.push('newspaper-reporter, the waiter, the shop-assistant. With the');
lines.push('independence of 400 pounds a year behind him, he enjoyed it immensely.');
lines.push('He never stayed long in one job, and generally closed his connection');
lines.push('with it by telling his employer (contrary to all etiquette as understood');
lines.push('between master and servant) exactly what he thought of him. He had');
lines.push('no difficulty in finding a new profession. Instead of experience and');
lines.push('testimonials he offered his personality and a sporting bet. He would');
lines.push('take no wages the first month, and--if he satisfied his employer--double');
lines.push('wages the second. He always got his double wages.');
lines.push('He was now thirty. He had come to Waldheim for a holiday, because');
lines.push('he liked the look of the station. His ticket entitled him to travel');
lines.push('further, but he had always intended to please himself in the matter.');
lines.push('Waldheim attracted him, and he had a suit-case in the carriage with him');
lines.push('and money in his pocket. Why not get out?');
lines.push('The landlady of \'The George\' was only too glad to put him up, and');
lines.push('promised that her husband would drive over that afternoon for his');
lines.push('luggage.');
lines.push('"And you would like some lunch, I expect, sir."');
lines.push('"Yes, but don\'t give yourself any trouble about it. Cold');
lines.push('anything-you\'ve-got."');
lines.push('"What about beef, sir?" she asked, as if she had a hundred varieties of');
lines.push('meat to select from, and was offering him her best.');
lines.push('"That will do splendidly. And a pint of beer."');
lines.push('While he was finishing his lunch, the landlord came in to ask about the');
lines.push('luggage. Antony ordered another pint, and soon had him talking.');
lines.push('"It must be rather fun to keep a country inn," he said, thinking that it');
lines.push('was about time he started another profession.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know about fun, sir. It gives us a living, and a bit over."');
lines.push('"You ought to take a holiday," said Antony, looking at him thoughtfully.');
lines.push('"Funny thing your saying that," said the landlord, with a smile.');
lines.push('"Another gentleman, over from the Red House, was saying that only');
lines.push('yesterday. Offered to take my place \'n all." He laughed rumblingly.');
lines.push('"The Red House? Not the Red House, Stanton?"');
lines.push('"That\'s right, sir. Stanton\'s the next station to Waldheim. The Red');
lines.push('House is about a mile from here--Mr. Ablett\'s."');
lines.push('Antony took a letter from his pocket. It was addressed from "The Red');
lines.push('House, Stanton," and signed "Bill."');
lines.push('"Good old Bill," he murmured to himself. "He\'s getting on."');
lines.push('Antony had met Bill Beverley two years before in a tobacconist\'s shop.');
lines.push('Gillingham was on one side of the counter and Mr. Beverley on the');
lines.push('other. Something about Bill, his youth and freshness, perhaps, attracted');
lines.push('Antony; and when cigarettes had been ordered, and an address given to');
lines.push('which they were to be sent, he remembered that he had come across an');
lines.push('aunt of Beverley\'s once at a country-house. Beverley and he met again');
lines.push('a little later at a restaurant. Both of them were in evening-dress, but');
lines.push('they did different things with their napkins, and Antony was the more');
lines.push('polite of the two. However, he still liked Bill. So on one of his');
lines.push('holidays, when he was unemployed, he arranged an introduction through a');
lines.push('mutual friend. Beverley was a little inclined to be shocked when he was');
lines.push('reminded of their previous meetings, but his uncomfortable feeling soon');
lines.push('wore off, and he and Antony quickly became intimate. But Bill generally');
lines.push('addressed him as "Dear Madman" when he happened to write.');
lines.push('Antony decided to stroll over to the Red House after lunch and call');
lines.push('upon his friend. Having inspected his bedroom which was not quite the');
lines.push('lavender-smelling country-inn bedroom of fiction, but sufficiently clean');
lines.push('and comfortable, he set out over the fields.');
lines.push('As he came down the drive and approached the old red-brick front of the');
lines.push('house, there was a lazy murmur of bees in the flower-borders, a gentle');
lines.push('cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms, and from distant lawns the');
lines.push('whir of a mowing-machine, that most restful of all country sounds....');
lines.push('And in the hall a man was banging at a locked door, and shouting, "Open');
lines.push('the door, I say; open the door!"');
lines.push('"Hallo!" said Antony in amazement.');
lines.push('CHAPTER III. Two Men and a Body');
lines.push('Cayley looked round suddenly at the voice.');
lines.push('"Can I help?" said Antony politely.');
lines.push('"Something\'s happened," said Cayley. He was breathing quickly. "I heard');
lines.push('a shot--it sounded like a shot--I was in the library. A loud bang--I');
lines.push('didn\'t know what it was. And the door\'s locked." He rattled the handle');
lines.push('again, and shook it. "Open the door!" he cried. "I say, Mark, what is');
lines.push('it? Open the door!"');
lines.push('"But he must have locked the door on purpose," said Antony. "So why');
lines.push('should he open it just because you ask him to?"');
lines.push('Cayley looked at him in a bewildered way. Then he turned to the door');
lines.push('again. "We must break it in," he said, putting his shoulder to it. "Help');
lines.push('me."');
lines.push('"Isn\'t there a window?"');
lines.push('Cayley turned to him stupidly.');
lines.push('"Window? Window?"');
lines.push('"So much easier to break in a window," said Antony with a smile. He');
lines.push('looked very cool and collected, as he stood just inside the hall,');
lines.push('leaning on his stick, and thinking, no doubt, that a great deal of fuss');
lines.push('was being made about nothing. But then, he had not heard the shot.');
lines.push('"Window--of course! What an idiot I am."');
lines.push('He pushed past Antony, and began running out into the drive. Antony');
lines.push('followed him. They ran along the front of the house, down a path to the');
lines.push('left, and then to the left again over the grass, Cayley in front, the');
lines.push('other close behind him. Suddenly Cayley looked over his shoulder and');
lines.push('pulled up short.');
lines.push('"Here," he said.');
lines.push('They had come to the windows of the locked room, French windows which');
lines.push('opened on to the lawns at the back of the house. But now they were');
lines.push('closed. Antony couldn\'t help feeling a thrill of excitement as he');
lines.push('followed Cayley\'s example, and put his face close up to the glass. For');
lines.push('the first time he wondered if there really had been a revolver shot in');
lines.push('this mysterious room. It had all seemed so absurd and melodramatic from');
lines.push('the other side of the door. But if there had been one shot, why should');
lines.push('there not be two more?--at the careless fools who were pressing their');
lines.push('noses against the panes, and asking for it.');
lines.push('"My God, can you see it?" said Cayley in a shaking voice. "Down there.');
lines.push('Look!"');
lines.push('The next moment Antony saw it. A man was lying on the floor at the far');
lines.push('end of the room, his back towards them. A man? Or the body of a man?');
lines.push('"Who is it?" said Antony.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know," the other whispered.');
lines.push('"Well, we\'d better go and see." He considered the windows for a moment.');
lines.push('"I should think, if you put your weight into it, just where they join,');
lines.push('they\'ll give all right. Otherwise, we can kick the glass in."');
lines.push('Without saying anything, Cayley put his weight into it. The window gave,');
lines.push('and they went into the room. Cayley walked quickly to the body, and');
lines.push('dropped on his knees by it. For the moment he seemed to hesitate; then');
lines.push('with an effort he put a hand on to its shoulder and pulled it over.');
lines.push('"Thank God!" he murmured, and let the body go again.');
lines.push('"Who is it?" said Antony.');
lines.push('"Robert Ablett."');
lines.push('"Oh!" said Antony. "I thought his name was Mark," he added, more to');
lines.push('himself than to the other.');
lines.push('"Yes, Mark Ablett lives here. Robert is his brother." He shuddered, and');
lines.push('said, "I was afraid it was Mark."');
lines.push('"Was Mark in the room too?"');
lines.push('"Yes," said Cayley absently. Then, as if resenting suddenly these');
lines.push('questions from a stranger, "Who are you?"');
lines.push('But Antony had gone to the locked door, and was turning the handle. "I');
lines.push('suppose he put the key in his pocket," he said, as he came back to the');
lines.push('body again.');
lines.push('"Who?"');
lines.push('Antony shrugged his shoulders.');
lines.push('"Whoever did this," he said, pointing to the man on the floor. "Is he');
lines.push('dead?"');
lines.push('"Help me," said Cayley simply.');
lines.push('They turned the body on to its back, nerving themselves to look at it.');
lines.push('Robert Ablett had been shot between the eyes. It was not a pleasant');
lines.push('sight, and with his horror Antony felt a sudden pity for the man beside');
lines.push('him, and a sudden remorse for the careless, easy way in which he had');
lines.push('treated the affair. But then one always went about imagining that');
lines.push('these things didn\'t happen--except to other people. It was difficult to');
lines.push('believe in them just at first, when they happened to yourself.');
lines.push('"Did you know him well?" said Antony quietly. He meant, "Were you fond');
lines.push('of him?"');
lines.push('"Hardly at all. Mark is my cousin. I mean, Mark is the brother I know');
lines.push('best."');
lines.push('"Your cousin?"');
lines.push('"Yes." He hesitated, and then said, "Is he dead? I suppose he is. Will');
lines.push('you--do you know anything about--about that sort of thing? Perhaps I\'d');
lines.push('better get some water."');
lines.push('There was another door opposite to the locked one, which led, as Antony');
lines.push('was to discover for himself directly, into a passage from which opened');
lines.push('two more rooms. Cayley stepped into the passage, and opened the door on');
lines.push('the right. The door from the office, through which he had gone, remained');
lines.push('open. The door, at the end of the short passage was shut. Antony,');
lines.push('kneeling by the body, followed Cayley with his eyes, and, after he had');
lines.push('disappeared, kept his eyes on the blank wall of the passage, but he was');
lines.push('not conscious of that at which he was looking, for his mind was with the');
lines.push('other man, sympathizing with him.');
lines.push('"Not that water is any use to a dead body," he said to himself, "but the');
lines.push('feeling that you\'re doing something, when there\'s obviously nothing to');
lines.push('be done, is a great comfort."');
lines.push('Cayley came into the room again. He had a sponge in one hand, a');
lines.push('handkerchief in the other. He looked at Antony. Antony nodded. Cayley');
lines.push('murmured something, and knelt down to bathe the dead man\'s face. Then he');
lines.push('placed the handkerchief over it. A little sigh escaped Antony, a sigh of');
lines.push('relief.');
lines.push('They stood up and looked at each other.');
lines.push('"If I can be of any help to you," said Antony, "please let me."');
lines.push('"That\'s very kind of you. There will be things to do. Police, doctors--I');
lines.push('don\'t know. But you mustn\'t let me trespass on your kindness. Indeed, I');
lines.push('should apologise for having trespassed so much already."');
lines.push('"I came to see Beverley. He is an old friend of mine."');
lines.push('"He\'s out playing golf. He will be back directly." Then, as if he had');
lines.push('only just realized it, "They will all be back directly."');
lines.push('"I will stay if I can be of any help."');
lines.push('"Please do. You see, there are women. It will be rather painful. If you');
lines.push('would--" He hesitated, and gave Antony a timid little smile, pathetic');
lines.push('in so big and self-reliant a man. "Just your moral support, you know. It');
lines.push('would be something."');
lines.push('"Of course." Antony smiled back at him, and said cheerfully, "Well,');
lines.push('then, I\'ll begin by suggesting that you should ring up the police."');
lines.push('"The police? Y-yes." He looked doubtfully at the other. "I suppose--"');
lines.push('Antony spoke frankly.');
lines.push('"Now, look here, Mr.--er--"');
lines.push('"Cayley. I\'m Mark Ablett\'s cousin. I live with him."');
lines.push('"My name\'s Gillingham. I\'m sorry, I ought to have told you before. Well');
lines.push('now, Mr. Cayley, we shan\'t do any good by pretending. Here\'s a man been');
lines.push('shot--well, somebody shot him."');
lines.push('"He might have shot himself," mumbled Cayley.');
lines.push('"Yes, he might have, but he didn\'t. Or if he did, somebody was in the');
lines.push('room at the time, and that somebody isn\'t here now. And that somebody');
lines.push('took a revolver away with him. Well, the police will want to say a word');
lines.push('about that, won\'t they?"');
lines.push('Cayley was silent, looking on the ground.');
lines.push('"Oh, I know what you\'re thinking, and believe me I do sympathize with');
lines.push('you, but we can\'t be children about it. If your cousin Mark Ablett was');
lines.push('in the room with this"--he indicated the body--"this man, then--"');
lines.push('"Who said he was?" said Cayley, jerking his head up suddenly at Antony.');
lines.push('"You did."');
lines.push('"I was in the library. Mark went in--he may have come out again--I know');
lines.push('nothing. Somebody else may have gone in--"');
lines.push('"Yes, yes," said Antony patiently, as if to a little child. "You know');
lines.push('your cousin; I don\'t. Let\'s agree that he had nothing to do with it. But');
lines.push('somebody was in the room when this man was shot, and--well, the police');
lines.push('will have to know. Don\'t you think--" He looked at the telephone. "Or');
lines.push('would you rather I did it?"');
lines.push('Cayley shrugged his shoulders and went to the telephone.');
lines.push('"May I--er--look round a bit?" Antony nodded towards the open door.');
lines.push('"Oh, do. Yes." He sat down and drew the telephone towards him. "You must');
lines.push('make allowances for me, Mr. Gillingham. You see, I\'ve known Mark for a');
lines.push('very long time. But, of course, you\'re quite right, and I\'m merely being');
lines.push('stupid." He took off the receiver.');
lines.push('Let us suppose that, for the purpose of making a first acquaintance with');
lines.push('this "office," we are coming into it from the hall, through the door');
lines.push('which is now locked, but which, for our special convenience, has been');
lines.push('magically unlocked for us. As we stand just inside the door, the length');
lines.push('of the room runs right and left; or, more accurately, to the right only,');
lines.push('for the left-hand wall is almost within our reach. Immediately opposite');
lines.push('to us, across the breadth of the room (some fifteen feet), is that other');
lines.push('door, by which Cayley went out and returned a few minutes ago. In the');
lines.push('right-hand wall, thirty feet away from us, are the French windows.');
lines.push('Crossing the room and going out by the opposite door, we come into a');
lines.push('passage, from which two rooms lead. The one on the right, into which');
lines.push('Cayley went, is less than half the length of the office, a small, square');
lines.push('room, which has evidently been used some time or other as a bedroom. The');
lines.push('bed is no longer there, but there is a basin, with hot and cold taps, in');
lines.push('a corner; chairs; a cupboard or two, and a chest of drawers. The window');
lines.push('faces the same way as the French windows in the next room; but anybody');
lines.push('looking out of the bedroom window has his view on the immediate right');
lines.push('shut off by the outer wall of the office, which projects, by reason of');
lines.push('its greater length, fifteen feet further into the lawn.');
lines.push('The room on the other side of the bedroom is a bathroom. The three rooms');
lines.push('together, in fact, form a sort of private suite; used, perhaps, during');
lines.push('the occupation of the previous owner, by some invalid, who could not');
lines.push('manage the stairs, but allowed by Mark to fall into disuse, save for the');
lines.push('living-room. At any rate, he never slept downstairs.');
lines.push('Antony glanced at the bathroom, and then wandered into the bedroom, the');
lines.push('room into which Cayley had been. The window was open, and he looked out');
lines.push('at the well-kept grass beneath him, and the peaceful stretch of park');
lines.push('beyond; and he felt very sorry for the owner of it all, who was now');
lines.push('mixed up in so grim a business.');
lines.push('"Cayley thinks he did it," said Antony to himself. "That\'s obvious. It');
lines.push('explains why he wasted so much time banging on the door. Why should');
lines.push('he try to break a lock when it\'s so much easier to break a window?');
lines.push('Of course he might just have lost his head; on the other hand, he');
lines.push('might--well, he might have wanted to give his cousin a chance of getting');
lines.push('away. The same about the police, and--oh, lots of things. Why, for');
lines.push('instance, did we run all the way round the house in order to get to the');
lines.push('windows? Surely there\'s a back way out through the hall. I must have a');
lines.push('look later on."');
lines.push('Antony, it will be observed, had by no means lost his head.');
lines.push('There was a step in the passage outside, and he turned round, to see');
lines.push('Cayley in the doorway. He remained looking at him for a moment, asking');
lines.push('himself a question. It was rather a curious question. He was asking');
lines.push('himself why the door was open.');
lines.push('Well, not exactly why the door was open; that could be explained easily');
lines.push('enough. But why had he expected the door to be shut? He did not remember');
lines.push('shutting it, but somehow he was surprised to see it open now, to see');
lines.push('Cayley through the doorway, just coming into the room. Something working');
lines.push('sub-consciously in his brain had told him that it was surprising. Why?');
lines.push('He tucked the matter away in a corner of his mind for the moment; the');
lines.push('answer would come to him later on. He had a wonderfully retentive');
lines.push('mind. Everything which he saw or heard seemed to make its corresponding');
lines.push('impression somewhere in his brain; often without his being conscious of');
lines.push('it; and these photographic impressions were always there ready for him');
lines.push('when he wished to develop them.');
lines.push('Cayley joined him at the window.');
lines.push('"I\'ve telephoned," he said. "They\'re sending an inspector or some one');
lines.push('from Middleston, and the local police and doctor from Stanton." He');
lines.push('shrugged his shoulders. "We\'re in for it now."');
lines.push('"How far away is Middleston?" It was the town for which Antony had taken');
lines.push('a ticket that morning--only six hours ago. How absurd it seemed.');
lines.push('"About twenty miles. These people will be coming back soon."');
lines.push('"Beverley, and the others?"');
lines.push('"Yes. I expect they\'ll want to go away at once."');
lines.push('"Much better that they should."');
lines.push('"Yes." Cayley was silent for a little. Then he said, "You\'re staying');
lines.push('near here?"');
lines.push('"I\'m at \'The George,\' at Waldheim."');
lines.push('"If you\'re by yourself, I wish you\'d put up here. You see," he went on');
lines.push('awkwardly, "you\'ll have to be here--for the--the inquest and--and so');
lines.push('on. If I may offer you my cousin\'s hospitality in his--I mean if he');
lines.push('doesn\'t--if he really has--"');
lines.push('Antony broke in hastily with his thanks and acceptance.');
lines.push('"That\'s good. Perhaps Beverley will stay on, if he\'s a friend of yours.');
lines.push('He\'s a good fellow."');
lines.push('Antony felt quite sure, from what Cayley had said and had hesitated to');
lines.push('say, that Mark had been the last to see his brother alive. It didn\'t');
lines.push('follow that Mark Ablett was a murderer. Revolvers go off accidentally;');
lines.push('and when they have gone off, people lose their heads and run away,');
lines.push('fearing that their story will not be believed. Nevertheless, when people');
lines.push('run away, whether innocently or guiltily, one can\'t help wondering which');
lines.push('way they went.');
lines.push('"I suppose this way," said Antony aloud, looking out of the window.');
lines.push('"Who?" said Cayley stubbornly.');
lines.push('"Well, whoever it was," said Antony, smiling to himself. "The murderer.');
lines.push('Or, let us say, the man who locked the door after Robert Ablett was');
lines.push('killed."');
lines.push('"I wonder."');
lines.push('"Well, how else could he have got away? He didn\'t go by the windows in');
lines.push('the next room, because they were shut."');
lines.push('"Isn\'t that rather odd?"');
lines.push('"Well, I thought so at first, but--" He pointed to the wall jutting out');
lines.push('on the right. "You see, you\'re protected from the rest of the house if');
lines.push('you get out here, and you\'re quite close to the shrubbery. If you go out');
lines.push('at the French windows, I imagine you\'re much more visible. All that part');
lines.push('of the house--" he waved his right hand--"the west, well, north-west');
lines.push('almost, where the kitchen parts are--you see, you\'re hidden from them');
lines.push('here. Oh, yes! he knew the house, whoever it was, and he was quite right');
lines.push('to come out of this window. He\'d be into the shrubbery at once."');
lines.push('Cayley looked at him thoughtfully.');
lines.push('"It seems to me, Mr. Gillingham, that you know the house pretty well,');
lines.push('considering that this is the first time you\'ve been to it."');
lines.push('Antony laughed.');
lines.push('"Oh, well, I notice things, you know. I was born noticing. But I\'m');
lines.push('right, aren\'t I, about why he went out this way?"');
lines.push('"Yes, I think you are." Cayley looked away--towards the shrubbery. "Do');
lines.push('you want to go noticing in there now?" He nodded at it.');
lines.push('"I think we might leave that to the police," said Antony gently.');
lines.push('"It\'s--well, there\'s no hurry."');
lines.push('Cayley gave a little sigh, as if he had been holding his breath for the');
lines.push('answer, and could now breathe again.');
lines.push('"Thank you, Mr. Gillingham," he said.');
lines.push('CHAPTER IV. The Brother from Australia');
lines.push('Guests at the Red House were allowed to do what they liked within');
lines.push('reason--the reasonableness or otherwise of it being decided by Mark. But');
lines.push('when once they (or Mark) had made up their minds as to what they wanted');
lines.push('to do, the plan had to be kept. Mrs. Calladine, who knew this little');
lines.push('weakness of their host\'s, resisted, therefore, the suggestion of Bill');
lines.push('that they should have a second round in the afternoon, and drive home');
lines.push('comfortably after tea. The other golfers were willing enough, but Mrs.');
lines.push('Calladine, without actually saying that Mr. Ablett wouldn\'t like it, was');
lines.push('firm on the point that, having arranged to be back by four, they should');
lines.push('be back by four.');
lines.push('"I really don\'t think Mark wants us, you know," said the Major. Having');
lines.push('played badly in the morning, he wanted to prove to himself in the');
lines.push('afternoon that he was really better than that. "With this brother of his');
lines.push('coming, he\'ll be only too glad to have us out of the way."');
lines.push('"Of course he will, Major." This from Bill. "You\'d like to play,');
lines.push('wouldn\'t you, Miss Norris?"');
lines.push('Miss Norris looked doubtfully at the hostess.');
lines.push('"Of course, if you want to get back, dear, we mustn\'t keep you here.');
lines.push('Besides, it\'s so dull for you, not playing."');
lines.push('"Just nine holes, mother," pleaded Betty.');
lines.push('"The car could take you back, and you could tell them that we were');
lines.push('having another round, and then it could come back for us," said Bill');
lines.push('brilliantly.');
lines.push('"It\'s certainly much cooler here than I expected," put in the Major.');
lines.push('Mrs. Calladine fell. It was very pleasantly cool outside the golf-house,');
lines.push('and of course Mark would be rather glad to have them out of the way. So');
lines.push('she consented to nine holes; and the match having ended all-square, and');
lines.push('everybody having played much better than in the morning, they drove back');
lines.push('to the Red House, very well pleased with themselves.');
lines.push('"Halo," said Bill to himself, as they approached the house, "isn\'t that');
lines.push('old Tony?"');
lines.push('Antony was standing in front of the house, waiting for them. Bill waved,');
lines.push('and he waved back. Then as the car drew up, Bill, who was in front with');
lines.push('the chauffeur, jumped down and greeted him eagerly.');
lines.push('"Hallo, you madman, have you come to stay, or what?" He had a sudden');
lines.push('idea. "Don\'t say you\'re Mark Ablett\'s long-lost brother from Australia,');
lines.push('though I could quite believe it of you." He laughed boyishly.');
lines.push('"Hallo, Bill," said Antony quietly. "Will you introduce me? I\'m afraid');
lines.push('I\'ve got some bad news."');
lines.push('Bill, rather sobered by this, introduced him. The Major and Mrs.');
lines.push('Calladine were on the near side of the car, and Antony spoke to them in');
lines.push('a low voice.');
lines.push('"I\'m afraid I\'m going to give you rather a shock," he said. "Robert');
lines.push('Ablett, Mr. Mark Ablett\'s brother, has been killed." He jerked a thumb');
lines.push('over his shoulder. "In the house."');
lines.push('"Good God!" said the Major.');
lines.push('"Do you mean that he has killed himself?" asked Mrs. Calladine. "Just');
lines.push('now?"');
lines.push('"It was about two hours ago. I happened to come here,"--he half-turned');
lines.push('to Beverley and explained--"I was coming to see you, Bill, and I arrived');
lines.push('just after the--the death. Mr. Cayley and I found the body. Mr. Cayley');
lines.push('being busy just now--there are police and doctors and so on in the');
lines.push('house--he asked me to tell you. He says that no doubt you would prefer,');
lines.push('the house-party having been broken up in this tragic way, to leave as');
lines.push('soon as possible." He gave a pleasant apologetic little smile and went');
lines.push('on, "I am putting it badly, but what he means, of course, is that you');
lines.push('must consult your own feelings in the matter entirely, and please make');
lines.push('your own arrangements about ordering the car for whatever train you wish');
lines.push('to catch. There is one this evening, I understand, which you could go by');
lines.push('if you wished it."');
lines.push('Bill gazed with open mouth at Antony. He had no words in his vocabulary');
lines.push('to express what he wanted to say, other than those the Major had');
lines.push('already used. Betty was leaning across to Miss Norris and saying, "Who\'s');
lines.push('killed?" in an awe-struck voice, and Miss Norris, who was instinctively');
lines.push('looking as tragic as she looked on the stage when a messenger announced');
lines.push('the death of one of the cast, stopped for a moment in order to explain.');
lines.push('Mrs. Calladine was quietly mistress of herself.');
lines.push('"We shall be in the way, yes, I quite understand," she said; "but we');
lines.push('can\'t just shake the dust of the place off our shoes because something');
lines.push('terrible has happened there. I must see Mark, and we can arrange later');
lines.push('what to do. He must know how very deeply we feel for him. Perhaps we--"');
lines.push('she hesitated.');
lines.push('"The Major and I might be useful anyway," said Bill. "Isn\'t that what');
lines.push('you mean, Mrs. Calladine?"');
lines.push('"Where is Mark?" said the Major suddenly, looking hard at Antony.');
lines.push('Antony looked back unwaveringly--and said nothing.');
lines.push('"I think," said the Major gently, leaning over to Mrs. Calladine, "that');
lines.push('it would be better if you took Betty back to London to-night."');
lines.push('"Very well," she agreed quietly. "You will come with us, Ruth?"');
lines.push('"I\'ll see you safely there," said Bill in a meek voice. He didn\'t quite');
lines.push('know what was happening, and, having expected to stay at the Red House');
lines.push('for another week, he had nowhere to go to in London, but London seemed');
lines.push('to be the place that everyone was going to, and when he could get Tony');
lines.push('alone for a moment, Tony no doubt would explain.');
lines.push('"Cayley wants you to stay, Bill. You have to go anyhow, to-morrow, Major');
lines.push('Rumbold?"');
lines.push('"Yes. I\'ll come with you, Mrs. Calladine."');
lines.push('"Mr. Cayley would wish me to say again that you will please not hesitate');
lines.push('to give your own orders, both as regard the car and as regard any');
lines.push('telephoning or telegraphing that you want done." He smiled again and');
lines.push('added, "Please forgive me if I seem to have taken a good deal upon');
lines.push('myself, but I just happened to be handy as a mouthpiece for Cayley." He');
lines.push('bowed to them and went into the house.');
lines.push('"Well!" said Miss Norris dramatically.');
lines.push('As Antony re-entered the hall, the Inspector from Middleston was just');
lines.push('crossing into the library with Cayley. The latter stopped and nodded to');
lines.push('Antony.');
lines.push('"Wait a moment, Inspector. Here\'s Mr. Gillingham. He\'d better come with');
lines.push('us." And then to Antony, "This is Inspector Birch."');
lines.push('Birch looked inquiringly from one to the other.');
lines.push('"Mr. Gillingham and I found the body together," explained Cayley.');
lines.push('"Oh! Well, come along, and let\'s get the facts sorted out a bit. I like');
lines.push('to know where I am, Mr. Gillingham."');
lines.push('"We all do."');
lines.push('"Oh!" He looked at Antony with interest. "D\'you know where you are in');
lines.push('this case?"');
lines.push('"I know where I\'m going to be."');
lines.push('"Where\'s that?"');
lines.push('"Put through it by Inspector Birch," said Antony with a smile.');
lines.push('The inspector laughed genially.');
lines.push('"Well, I\'ll spare you as much as I can. Come along."');
lines.push('They went into the library. The inspector seated himself at a');
lines.push('writing-table, and Cayley sat in a chair by the side of it. Antony made');
lines.push('himself comfortable in an armchair and prepared to be interested.');
lines.push('"We\'ll start with the dead man," said the Inspector. "Robert Ablett,');
lines.push('didn\'t you say?" He took out his notebook.');
lines.push('"Yes. Brother of Mark Ablett, who lives here."');
lines.push('"Ah!" He began to sharpen a pencil. "Staying in the house?"');
lines.push('"Oh, no!"');
lines.push('Antony listened attentively while Cayley explained all that he knew');
lines.push('about Robert. This was news to him. "I see. Sent out of the country in');
lines.push('disgrace. What had he done?"');
lines.push('"I hardly know. I was only about twelve at the time. The sort of age');
lines.push('when you\'re told not to ask questions."');
lines.push('"Inconvenient questions?"');
lines.push('"Exactly."');
lines.push('"So you don\'t really know whether he had been merely wild or--or');
lines.push('wicked?"');
lines.push('"No. Old Mr. Ablett was a clergyman," added Cayley. "Perhaps what might');
lines.push('seem wicked to a clergyman might seem only wild to a man of the world."');
lines.push('"I daresay, Mr. Cayley," smiled the Inspector. "Anyhow, it was more');
lines.push('convenient to have him in Australia?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"Mark Ablett never talked about him?"');
lines.push('"Hardly ever. He was very much ashamed of him, and--well, very glad he');
lines.push('was in Australia."');
lines.push('"Did he write Mark sometimes?"');
lines.push('"Occasionally. Perhaps three or four times in the last five years."');
lines.push('"Asking for money?"');
lines.push('"Something of the sort. I don\'t think Mark always answered them. As far');
lines.push('as I know, he never sent any money."');
lines.push('"Now your own private opinion, Mr. Cayley. Do you think that Mark was');
lines.push('unfair to his brother? Unduly hard on him?"');
lines.push('"They\'d never liked each other as boys. There was never any affection');
lines.push('between them. I don\'t know whose fault it was in the first place--if');
lines.push('anybody\'s."');
lines.push('"Still, Mark might have given him a hand?"');
lines.push('"I understand," said Cayley, "that Robert spent his whole life asking');
lines.push('for hands."');
lines.push('The inspector nodded.');
lines.push('"I know that sort. Well, now, we\'ll go on to this morning. This letter');
lines.push('that Mark got--did you see it?"');
lines.push('"Not at the time. He showed it to me afterwards."');
lines.push('"Any address?"');
lines.push('"No. A half-sheet of rather dirty paper."');
lines.push('"Where is it now?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t know. In Mark\'s pocket, I expect."');
lines.push('"Ah!" He pulled at his beard. "Well, we\'ll come to that. Can you');
lines.push('remember what it said?"');
lines.push('"As far as I remember, something like this: \'Mark, your loving brother');
lines.push('is coming to see you to-morrow, all the way from Australia. I give you');
lines.push('warning so that you will be able to conceal your surprise, but not I');
lines.push('hope, your pleasure. Expect him at three, or thereabouts.\'"');
lines.push('"Ah!" The inspector copied it down carefully. "Did you notice the');
lines.push('postmark?"');
lines.push('"London."');
lines.push('"And what was Mark\'s attitude?"');
lines.push('"Annoyance, disgust--" Cayley hesitated.');
lines.push('"Apprehension?"');
lines.push('"N-no, not exactly. Or, rather, apprehension of an unpleasant interview,');
lines.push('not of any unpleasant outcome for himself."');
lines.push('"You mean that he wasn\'t afraid of violence, or blackmail, or anything');
lines.push('of that sort?"');
lines.push('"He didn\'t appear to be."');
lines.push('"Right.... Now then, he arrived, you say, about three o\'clock?"');
lines.push('"Yes, about that."');
lines.push('"Who was in the house then?"');
lines.push('"Mark and myself, and some of the servants. I don\'t know which. Of');
lines.push('course, you will ask them directly, no doubt."');
lines.push('"With your permission. No guests?"');
lines.push('"They were out all day playing golf," explained Cayley. "Oh, by the');
lines.push('way," he put in, "if I may interrupt a moment, will you want to see');
lines.push('them at all? It isn\'t very pleasant for them now, naturally, and I');
lines.push('suggested--" he turned to Antony, who nodded back to him. "I understand');
lines.push('that they want to go back to London this evening. There\'s no objection');
lines.push('to that, I suppose?"');
lines.push('"You will let me have their names and addresses in case I want to');
lines.push('communicate with them?"');
lines.push('"Of course. One of them is staying on, if you would like to see him');
lines.push('later, but they only came back from their golf as we crossed the hall."');
lines.push('"That\'s all right, Mr. Cayley. Well, now then, let\'s go back to three');
lines.push('o\'clock. Where were you when Robert arrived?"');
lines.push('Cayley explained how he had been sitting in the hall, how Audrey had');
lines.push('asked him where the master was, and how he had said that he had last');
lines.push('seen him going up to the Temple.');
lines.push('"She went away, and I went on with my book. There was a step on the');
lines.push('stairs, and I looked up to see Mark coming down. He went into the');
lines.push('office, and I went on with my book again. I went into the library for');
lines.push('a moment, to refer to another book, and when I was in there I heard a');
lines.push('shot. At least, it was a loud bang, I wasn\'t sure if it was a shot. I');
lines.push('stood and listened. Then I came slowly to the door and looked out. Then');
lines.push('I went back again, hesitated a bit, you know, and finally decided to go');
lines.push('across to the office, and make sure that it was all right. I turned the');
lines.push('handle of the door and found it was locked. Then I got frightened, and I');
lines.push('banged at the door, and shouted, and--well, that was when Mr. Gillingham');
lines.push('arrived." He went on to explain how they had found the body.');
lines.push('The inspector looked at him with a smile.');
lines.push('"Yes, well, we shall have to go over some of that again, Mr. Cayley. Mr.');
lines.push('Mark, now. You thought he was in the Temple. Could he have come in, and');
lines.push('gone up to his room, without your seeing him?"');
lines.push('"There are back stairs. He wouldn\'t have used them in the ordinary way,');
lines.push('of course. But I wasn\'t in the hall all the afternoon. He might easily');
lines.push('have gone upstairs without my knowing anything about it."');
lines.push('"So that you weren\'t surprised when you saw him coming down?"');
lines.push('"Oh, not a bit."');
lines.push('"Well, did he say anything?"');
lines.push('"He said, \'Robert\'s here?\' or something of the sort. I suppose he\'d');
lines.push('heard the bell, or the voices in the hall."');
lines.push('"Which way does his bedroom face? Could he have seen him coming down the');
lines.push('drive?"');
lines.push('"He might have, yes."');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"Well, then, I said \'Yes,\' and he gave a sort of shrug, and said, \'Don\'t');
lines.push('go too far away, I might want you\'; and then went in."');
lines.push('"What did you think he meant by that?"');
lines.push('"Well, he consults me a good deal, you know. I\'m his sort of unofficial');
lines.push('solicitor in a kind of way."');
lines.push('"This was a business meeting rather than a brotherly one?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes. That\'s how he regarded it, I\'m sure."');
lines.push('"Yes. How long was it before you heard the shot?"');
lines.push('"Very soon. Two minutes, perhaps."');
lines.push('The inspector finished his writing, and then regarded Cayley');
lines.push('thoughtfully. Suddenly he said:');
lines.push('"What is your theory of Robert\'s death?"');
lines.push('Cayley shrugged his shoulders.');
lines.push('"You\'ve probably seen more than I\'ve seen," he answered. "It\'s your job.');
lines.push('I can only speak as a layman--and Mark\'s friend."');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"Then I should say that Robert came here meaning trouble, and bringing');
lines.push('a revolver with him. He produced it almost at once, Mark tried to get');
lines.push('it from him, there was a little struggle perhaps, and it went off. Mark');
lines.push('lost his head, finding himself there with a revolver in his hand and');
lines.push('a dead man at his feet. His one idea was to escape. He locked the door');
lines.push('almost instinctively, and then, when he heard me hammering at it, went');
lines.push('out of the window."');
lines.push('"Y-yes. Well, that sounds reasonable enough. What do you say, Mr.');
lines.push('Gillingham?"');
lines.push('"I should hardly call it \'reasonable\' to lose your head," said Antony,');
lines.push('getting up from his chair and coming towards them.');
lines.push('"Well, you know what I mean. It explains things."');
lines.push('"Oh, yes. Any other explanation would make them much more complicated."');
lines.push('"Have you any other explanation?"');
lines.push('"Not I."');
lines.push('"Are there any points on which you would like to correct Mr.');
lines.push('Cayley?--anything that he left out after you arrived here?"');
lines.push('"No, thanks. He described it all very accurately."');
lines.push('"Ah! Well now, about yourself. You\'re not staying in the house, I');
lines.push('gather?"');
lines.push('Antony explained his previous movements.');
lines.push('"Yes. Did you hear the shot?"');
lines.push('Antony put his head on one side, as if listening. "Yes. Just as I came');
lines.push('in sight of the house. It didn\'t make any impression at the time, but I');
lines.push('remember it now."');
lines.push('"Where were you then?"');
lines.push('"Coming up the drive. I was just in sight of the house."');
lines.push('"Nobody left the house by the front door after the shot?"');
lines.push('Antony closed his eyes and considered.');
lines.push('"Nobody," he said. "No."');
lines.push('"You\'re certain of that?"');
lines.push('"Absolutely," said Antony, as though rather surprised that he could be');
lines.push('suspected of a mistake.');
lines.push('"Thank you. You\'re at \'The George,\' if I want you?"');
lines.push('"Mr. Gillingham is staying here until after the inquest," explained');
lines.push('Cayley.');
lines.push('"Good. Well now, about these servants?"');
lines.push('CHAPTER V. Mr. Gillingham Chooses a New Profession');
lines.push('As Cayley went over to the bell, Antony got up and moved to the door.');
lines.push('"Well, you won\'t want me, I suppose, inspector," he said.');
lines.push('"No, thank you, Mr. Gillingham. You\'ll be about, of course?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes."');
lines.push('The inspector hesitated.');
lines.push('"I think, Mr. Cayley, it would be better if I saw the servants alone.');
lines.push('You know what they are; the more people about, the more they get');
lines.push('alarmed. I expect I can get at the truth better by myself."');
lines.push('"Oh, quite so. In fact, I was going to ask you to excuse me. I feel');
lines.push('rather responsible towards these guests of ours. Although Mr. Gillingham');
lines.push('very kindly--" He smiled at Antony, who was waiting at the door, and');
lines.push('left his sentence unfinished.');
lines.push('"Ah, that reminds me," said the Inspector. "Didn\'t you say that one of');
lines.push('your guests--Mr. Beverley was it?--a friend of Mr. Gillingham\'s, was');
lines.push('staying on?"');
lines.push('"Yes; would you like to see him?"');
lines.push('"Afterwards, if I may."');
lines.push('"I\'ll warn him. I shall be up in my room, if you want me. I have a room');
lines.push('upstairs where I work--any of the servants will show you. Ah, Stevens,');
lines.push('Inspector Birch would like to ask you a few questions."');
lines.push('"Yes, sir," said Audrey primly, but inwardly fluttering. The');
lines.push('housekeeper\'s room had heard something of the news by this time, and');
lines.push('Audrey had had a busy time explaining to other members of the staff');
lines.push('exactly what he had said, and what she had said. The details were not');
lines.push('quite established yet, but this much at least was certain: that Mr.');
lines.push('Mark\'s brother had shot himself and spirited Mr. Mark away, and that');
lines.push('Audrey had seen at once that he was that sort of man when she opened');
lines.push('the door to him. She had passed the remark to Mrs. Stevens. And Mrs.');
lines.push('Stevens--if you remember, Audrey--had always said that people didn\'t go');
lines.push('away to Australia except for very good reasons. Elsie agreed with both');
lines.push('of them, but she had a contribution of her own to make. She had actually');
lines.push('heard Mr. Mark in the office, threatening his brother.');
lines.push('"You mean Mr. Robert," said the second parlour-maid. She had been having');
lines.push('a little nap in her room, but she had heard the bang. In fact, it had');
lines.push('woken her up--just like something going off, it was.');
lines.push('"It was Mr. Mark\'s voice," said Elsie firmly.');
lines.push('"Pleading for mercy," said an eager-eyed kitchen-maid hopefully from the');
lines.push('door, and was hurried out again by the others, wishing that she had not');
lines.push('given her presence away. But it was hard to listen in silence when she');
lines.push('knew so well from her novelettes just what happened on these occasions.');
lines.push('"I shall have to give that girl a piece of my mind," said Mrs. Stevens.');
lines.push('"Well, Elsie?"');
lines.push('"He said, I heard him say it with my own ears, \'It\'s my turn now,\' he');
lines.push('said, triumphant-like."');
lines.push('"Well, if you think that\'s a threat, dear, you\'re very particular, I');
lines.push('must say."');
lines.push('But Audrey remembered Elsie\'s words when she was in front of Inspector');
lines.push('Birch. She gave her own evidence with the readiness of one who had');
lines.push('already repeated it several times, and was examined and cross-examined');
lines.push('by the Inspector with considerable skill. The temptation to say, "Never');
lines.push('mind about what you said to him," was strong, but he resisted it,');
lines.push('knowing that in this way he would discover best what he said to her. By');
lines.push('this time both his words and the looks he gave her were getting their');
lines.push('full value from Audrey, but the general meaning of them seemed to be');
lines.push('well-established.');
lines.push('"Then you didn\'t see Mr. Mark at all."');
lines.push('"No, sir; he must have come in before and gone up to his room. Or come');
lines.push('in by the front door, likely enough, while I was going out by the back."');
lines.push('"Yes. Well, I think that\'s all that I want to know, thank you very much.');
lines.push('Now what about the other servants?"');
lines.push('"Elsie heard the master and Mr. Robert talking together," said Audrey');
lines.push('eagerly. "He was saying--Mr. Mark, I mean--"');
lines.push('"Ah! Well, I think Elsie had better tell me that herself. Who is Elsie,');
lines.push('by the way?"');
lines.push('"One of the housemaids. Shall I send her to you, sir?"');
lines.push('"Please."');
lines.push('Elsie was not sorry to get the message. It interrupted a few remarks');
lines.push('from Mrs. Stevens about Elsie\'s conduct that afternoon which were (Elsie');
lines.push('thought) much better interrupted. In Mrs. Stevens\' opinion any crime');
lines.push('committed that afternoon in the office was as nothing to the double');
lines.push('crime committed by the unhappy Elsie.');
lines.push('For Elsie realized too late that she would have done better to have said');
lines.push('nothing about her presence in the hall that afternoon. She was bad at');
lines.push('concealing the truth and Mrs. Stevens was good at discovering it. Elsie');
lines.push('knew perfectly well that she had no business to come down the front');
lines.push('stairs, and it was no excuse to say that she happened to come out of');
lines.push('Miss Norris\' room just at the head of the stairs, and didn\'t think it');
lines.push('would matter, as there was nobody in the hall, and what was she doing');
lines.push('anyhow in Miss Norris\' room at that time? Returning a magazine? Lent by');
lines.push('Miss Norris, might she ask? Well, not exactly lent. Really, Elsie!--and');
lines.push('this in a respectable house! In vain for poor Elsie to plead that');
lines.push('a story by her favourite author was advertised on the cover, with a');
lines.push('picture of the villain falling over the cliff. "That\'s where you\'ll go');
lines.push('to, my girl, if you aren\'t careful," said Mrs. Stevens firmly.');
lines.push('But, of course, there was no need to confess all these crimes to');
lines.push('Inspector Birch. All that interested him was that she was passing');
lines.push('through the hall, and heard voices in the office.');
lines.push('"And stopped to listen?"');
lines.push('"Certainly not," said Elsie with dignity, feeling that nobody really');
lines.push('understood her. "I was just passing through the hall, just as you might');
lines.push('have been yourself, and not supposing they was talking secrets, didn\'t');
lines.push('think to stop my ears, as no doubt I ought to have done." And she');
lines.push('sniffed slightly.');
lines.push('"Come, come," said the Inspector soothingly, "I didn\'t mean to');
lines.push('suggest--"');
lines.push('"Everyone is very unkind to me," said Elsie between sniffs, "and there\'s');
lines.push('that poor man lying dead there, and sorry they\'d have been, if it had');
lines.push('been me, to have spoken to me as they have done this day."');
lines.push('"Nonsense, we\'re going to be very proud of you. I shouldn\'t be surprised');
lines.push('if your evidence were of very great importance. Now then, what was it');
lines.push('you heard? Try to remember the exact words."');
lines.push('Something about working in a passage, thought Elsie.');
lines.push('"Yes, but who said it?"');
lines.push('"Mr. Robert."');
lines.push('"How do you know it was Mr. Robert? Had you heard his voice before?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t take it upon myself to say that I had had any acquaintance with');
lines.push('Mr. Robert, but seeing that it wasn\'t Mr. Mark, nor yet Mr. Cayley, nor');
lines.push('any other of the gentlemen, and Miss Stevens had shown Mr. Robert into');
lines.push('the office not five minutes before--"');
lines.push('"Quite so," said the Inspector hurriedly. "Mr. Robert, undoubtedly.');
lines.push('Working in a passage?"');
lines.push('"That was what it sounded like, sir."');
lines.push('"H\'m. Working a passage over--could that have been it?"');
lines.push('"That\'s right, sir," said Elsie eagerly. "He\'d worked his passage over."');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"And then Mr. Mark said loudly--sort of triumphant-like--\'It\'s my turn');
lines.push('now. You wait.\'"');
lines.push('"Triumphantly?"');
lines.push('"As much as to say his chance had come."');
lines.push('"And that\'s all you heard?"');
lines.push('"That\'s all, sir--not standing there listening, but just passing through');
lines.push('the hall, as it might be any time."');
lines.push('"Yes. Well, that\'s really very important, Elsie. Thank you."');
lines.push('Elsie gave him a smile, and returned eagerly to the kitchen. She was');
lines.push('ready for Mrs. Stevens or anybody now.');
lines.push('Meanwhile Antony had been exploring a little on his own. There was a');
lines.push('point which was puzzling him. He went through the hall to the front of');
lines.push('the house and stood at the open door, looking out on to the drive. He');
lines.push('and Cayley had run round the house to the left. Surely it would have');
lines.push('been quicker to have run round to the right? The front door was not in');
lines.push('the middle of the house, it was to the end. Undoubtedly they went the');
lines.push('longest way round. But perhaps there was something in the way, if one');
lines.push('went to the right--a wall, say. He strolled off in that direction,');
lines.push('followed a path round the house and came in sight of the office windows.');
lines.push('Quite simple, and about half the distance of the other way. He went on');
lines.push('a little farther, and came to a door, just beyond the broken-in windows.');
lines.push('It opened easily, and he found himself in a passage. At the end of the');
lines.push('passage was another door. He opened it and found himself in the hall');
lines.push('again.');
lines.push('"And, of course, that\'s the quickest way of the three," he said to');
lines.push('himself. "Through the hall, and out at the back; turn to the left and');
lines.push('there you are. Instead of which, we ran the longest way round the house.');
lines.push('Why? Was it to give Mark more time in which to escape? Only, in that');
lines.push('case--why run? Also, how did Cayley know then that it was Mark who');
lines.push('was trying to escape? If he had guessed--well, not guessed, but been');
lines.push('afraid--that one had shot the other, it was much more likely that Robert');
lines.push('had shot Mark. Indeed, he had admitted that this was what he thought.');
lines.push('The first thing he had said when he turned the body over was, \'Thank');
lines.push('God! I was afraid it was Mark.\' But why should he want to give Robert');
lines.push('time in which to get away? And again--why run, if he did want to give');
lines.push('him time?"');
lines.push('Antony went out of the house again to the lawns at the back, and sat');
lines.push('down on a bench in view of the office windows.');
lines.push('"Now then," he said, "let\'s go through Cayley\'s mind carefully, and see');
lines.push('what we get."');
lines.push('Cayley had been in the hall when Robert was shown into the office. The');
lines.push('servant goes off to look for Mark, and Cayley goes on with his book.');
lines.push('Mark comes down the stairs, warns Cayley to stand by in case he is');
lines.push('wanted, and goes to meet his brother. What does Cayley expect? Possibly');
lines.push('that he won\'t be wanted at all; possibly that his advice may be wanted');
lines.push('in the matter, say, of paying Robert\'s debts, or getting him a passage');
lines.push('back to Australia; possibly that his physical assistance may be wanted');
lines.push('to get an obstreperous Robert out of the house. Well, he sits there for');
lines.push('a moment, and then goes into the library. Why not? He is still within');
lines.push('reach, if wanted. Suddenly he hears a pistol-shot. A pistol-shot is the');
lines.push('last noise you expect to hear in a country-house; very natural, then,');
lines.push('that for the moment he would hardly realize what it was. He listens--and');
lines.push('hears nothing more. Perhaps it wasn\'t a pistol-shot after all. After a');
lines.push('moment or two he goes to the library door again. The profound silence');
lines.push('makes him uneasy now. Was it a pistol-shot? Absurd! Still--no harm in');
lines.push('going into the office on some excuse, just to reassure himself. So he');
lines.push('tries the door--and finds it locked!');
lines.push('What are his emotions now? Alarm, uncertainty. Something is happening.');
lines.push('Incredible though it seems, it must have been a pistol-shot. He is');
lines.push('banging at the door and calling out to Mark, and there is no answer.');
lines.push('Alarm--yes. But alarm for whose safety? Mark\'s, obviously. Robert is a');
lines.push('stranger; Mark is an intimate friend. Robert has written a letter that');
lines.push('morning, the letter of a man in a dangerous temper. Robert is the tough');
lines.push('customer; Mark the highly civilized gentleman. If there has been a');
lines.push('quarrel, it is Robert who has shot Mark. He bangs at the door again.');
lines.push('Of course, to Antony, coming suddenly upon this scene, Cayley\'s conduct');
lines.push('had seemed rather absurd, but then, just for the moment, Cayley had lost');
lines.push('his head. Anybody else might have done the same. But, as soon as Antony');
lines.push('suggested trying the windows, Cayley saw that that was the obvious thing');
lines.push('to do. So he leads the way to the windows--the longest way.');
lines.push('Why? To give the murderer time to escape? If he had thought then that');
lines.push('Mark was the murderer, perhaps, yes. But he thinks that Robert is the');
lines.push('murderer. If he is not hiding anything, he must think so. Indeed he says');
lines.push('so, when he sees the body; "I was afraid it was Mark," he says, when he');
lines.push('finds that it is Robert who is killed. No reason, then, for wishing to');
lines.push('gain time. On the contrary, every instinct would urge him to get into');
lines.push('the room as quickly as possible, and seize the wicked Robert. Yet he');
lines.push('goes the longest way round. Why? And then, why run?');
lines.push('"That\'s the question," said Antony to himself, as he filled his pipe,');
lines.push('"and bless me if I know the answer. It may be, of course, that Cayley is');
lines.push('just a coward. He was in no hurry to get close to Robert\'s revolver, and');
lines.push('yet wanted me to think that he was bursting with eagerness. That would');
lines.push('explain it, but then that makes Cayley out a coward. Is he? At any rate');
lines.push('he pushed his face up against the window bravely enough. No, I want a');
lines.push('better answer than that."');
lines.push('He sat there with his unlit pipe in his hand, thinking. There were one');
lines.push('or two other things in the back of his brain, waiting to be taken out');
lines.push('and looked at. For the moment he left them undisturbed. They would come');
lines.push('back to him later when he wanted them.');
lines.push('He laughed suddenly, and lit his pipe.');
lines.push('"I was wanting a new profession," he thought, "and now I\'ve found it.');
lines.push('Antony Gillingham, our own private sleuthhound. I shall begin to-day."');
lines.push('Whatever Antony Gillingham\'s other qualifications for his new');
lines.push('profession, he had at any rate a brain which worked clearly and quickly.');
lines.push('And this clear brain of his had already told him that he was the only');
lines.push('person in the house at that moment who was unhandicapped in the search');
lines.push('for truth. The inspector had arrived in it to find a man dead and a man');
lines.push('missing. It was extremely probable, no doubt, that the missing man');
lines.push('had shot the dead man. But it was more than extremely probable, it was');
lines.push('almost certain that the Inspector would start with the idea that this');
lines.push('extremely probable solution was the one true solution, and that, in');
lines.push('consequence, he would be less disposed to consider without prejudice any');
lines.push('other solution. As regards all the rest of them--Cayley, the guests,');
lines.push('the servants--they also were prejudiced; in favour of Mark (or possibly,');
lines.push('for all he knew, against Mark); in favour of, or against, each other;');
lines.push('they had formed some previous opinion, from what had been said that');
lines.push('morning, of the sort of man Robert was. No one of them could consider');
lines.push('the matter with an unbiased mind.');
lines.push('But Antony could. He knew nothing about Mark; he knew nothing about');
lines.push('Robert. He had seen the dead man before he was told who the dead man');
lines.push('was. He knew that a tragedy had happened before he knew that anybody was');
lines.push('missing. Those first impressions, which are so vitally important, had');
lines.push('been received solely on the merits of the case; they were founded on the');
lines.push('evidence of his senses, not on the evidence of his emotions or of other');
lines.push('people\'s senses. He was in a much better position for getting at the');
lines.push('truth than was the Inspector.');
lines.push('It is possible that, in thinking this, Antony was doing Inspector Birch');
lines.push('a slight injustice. Birch was certainly prepared to believe that Mark');
lines.push('had shot his brother. Robert had been shown into the office (witness');
lines.push('Audrey); Mark had gone in to Robert (witness Cayley); Mark and Robert');
lines.push('had been heard talking (witness Elsie); there was a shot (witness');
lines.push('everybody); the room had been entered and Robert\'s body had been found');
lines.push('(witness Cayley and Gillingham). And Mark was missing. Obviously,');
lines.push('then, Mark had killed his brother: accidentally, as Cayley believed, or');
lines.push('deliberately, as Elsie\'s evidence seemed to suggest. There was no point');
lines.push('in looking for a difficult solution to a problem, when the easy solution');
lines.push('had no flaw in it. But at the same time Birch would have preferred the');
lines.push('difficult solution, simply because there was more credit attached to');
lines.push('it. A "sensational" arrest of somebody in the house would have given him');
lines.push('more pleasure than a commonplace pursuit of Mark Ablett across');
lines.push('country. Mark must be found, guilty or not guilty. But there were other');
lines.push('possibilities. It would have interested Antony to know that, just at the');
lines.push('time when he was feeling rather superior to the prejudiced inspector,');
lines.push('the Inspector himself was letting his mind dwell lovingly upon');
lines.push('the possibilities in connection with Mr. Gillingham. Was it only a');
lines.push('coincidence that Mr. Gillingham had turned up just when he did? And Mr.');
lines.push('Beverley\'s curious answers when asked for some account of his friend.');
lines.push('An assistant in a tobacconist\'s, a waiter! An odd man, Mr. Gillingham,');
lines.push('evidently. It might be as well to keep an eye on him.');
lines.push('CHAPTER VI. Outside Or Inside?');
lines.push('The guests had said good-bye to Cayley, according to their different');
lines.push('manner. The Major, gruff and simple: "If you want me, command me.');
lines.push('Anything I can do--Good-bye"; Betty, silently sympathetic, with');
lines.push('everything in her large eyes which she was too much overawed to tell;');
lines.push('Mrs. Calladine, protesting that she did not know what to say, but');
lines.push('apparently finding plenty; and Miss Norris, crowding so much into one');
lines.push('despairing gesture that Cayley\'s unvarying "Thank you very much" might');
lines.push('have been taken this time as gratitude for an artistic entertainment.');
lines.push('Bill had seen them into the car, had taken his own farewells (with a');
lines.push('special squeeze of the hand for Betty), and had wandered out to join');
lines.push('Antony on his garden seat.');
lines.push('"Well, this is a rum show," said Bill as he sat down.');
lines.push('"Very rum, William."');
lines.push('"And you actually walked right into it?"');
lines.push('"Right into it," said Antony.');
lines.push('"Then you\'re the man I want. There are all sorts of rumours and');
lines.push('mysteries about, and that inspector fellow simply wouldn\'t keep to the');
lines.push('point when I wanted to ask him about the murder, or whatever it is, but');
lines.push('kept asking me questions about where I\'d met you first, and all sorts of');
lines.push('dull things like that. Now, what really happened?"');
lines.push('Antony told him as concisely as he could all that he had already told');
lines.push('the Inspector, Bill interrupting him here and there with appropriate');
lines.push('"Good Lords" and whistles.');
lines.push('"I say, it\'s a bit of a business, isn\'t it? Where do I come in,');
lines.push('exactly?"');
lines.push('"How do you mean?"');
lines.push('"Well, everybody else is bundled off except me, and I get put through it');
lines.push('by that inspector as if I knew all about it--what\'s the idea?"');
lines.push('Antony smiled at him.');
lines.push('"Well, there\'s nothing to worry about, you know. Naturally Birch wanted');
lines.push('to see one of you so as to know what you\'d all been doing all day. And');
lines.push('Cayley was nice enough to think that you\'d be company for me, as I knew');
lines.push('you already. And well, that\'s all."');
lines.push('"You\'re staying here, in the house?" said Bill eagerly. "Good man.');
lines.push('That\'s splendid."');
lines.push('"It reconciles you to the departure of some of the others?"');
lines.push('Bill blushed.');
lines.push('"Oh, well, I shall see her again next week, anyway," he murmured.');
lines.push('"I congratulate you. I liked her looks. And that grey dress. A nice');
lines.push('comfortable sort of woman."');
lines.push('"You fool, that\'s her mother."');
lines.push('"Oh, I beg your pardon. But anyhow, Bill, I want you more than she does');
lines.push('just now. So try and put up with me."');
lines.push('"I say, do you really?" said Bill, rather flattered. He had a great');
lines.push('admiration for Antony, and was very proud to be liked by him.');
lines.push('"Yes. You see, things are going to happen here soon."');
lines.push('"Inquests and that sort of thing?"');
lines.push('"Well, perhaps something before that. Hallo, here comes Cayley."');
lines.push('Cayley was walking across the lawn towards them, a big, heavy-shouldered');
lines.push('man, with one of those strong, clean-shaven, ugly faces which can never');
lines.push('quite be called plain. "Bad luck on Cayley," said Bill. "I say, ought');
lines.push('I to tell him how sorry I am and all that sort of thing? It seems so');
lines.push('dashed inadequate."');
lines.push('"I shouldn\'t bother," said Antony.');
lines.push('Cayley nodded as he came to them, and stood there for a moment.');
lines.push('"We can make room for you," said Bill, getting up.');
lines.push('"Oh, don\'t bother, thanks. I just came to say," he went on to Antony,');
lines.push('"that naturally they\'ve rather lost their heads in the kitchen,');
lines.push('and dinner won\'t be till half-past eight. Do just as you like about');
lines.push('dressing, of course. And what about your luggage?"');
lines.push('"I thought Bill and I would walk over to the inn directly, and see about');
lines.push('it."');
lines.push('"The car can go and fetch it as soon as it comes back from the station."');
lines.push('"It\'s very good of you, but I shall have to go over myself, anyhow, to');
lines.push('pack up and pay my bill. Besides, it\'s a good evening for a walk. If you');
lines.push('wouldn\'t mind it, Bill?"');
lines.push('"I should love it."');
lines.push('"Well, then, if you leave the bag there, I\'ll send the car round for it');
lines.push('later."');
lines.push('"Thanks very much."');
lines.push('Having said what he wanted to say, Cayley remained there a little');
lines.push('awkwardly, as if not sure whether to go or to stay. Antony wondered');
lines.push('whether he wanted to talk about the afternoon\'s happenings, or whether');
lines.push('it was the one subject he wished to avoid. To break the silence he asked');
lines.push('carelessly if the Inspector had gone.');
lines.push('Cayley nodded. Then he said abruptly, "He\'s getting a warrant for Mark\'s');
lines.push('arrest."');
lines.push('Bill made a suitably sympathetic noise, and Antony said with a shrug');
lines.push('of the shoulders, "Well, he was bound to do that, wasn\'t he? It doesn\'t');
lines.push('follow that--well, it doesn\'t mean anything. They naturally want to get');
lines.push('hold of your cousin, innocent or guilty."');
lines.push('"Which do you think he is, Mr. Gillingham?" said Cayley, looking at him');
lines.push('steadily.');
lines.push('"Mark? It\'s absurd," said Bill impetuously.');
lines.push('"Bill\'s loyal, you see, Mr. Cayley."');
lines.push('"And you owe no loyalty to anyone concerned?"');
lines.push('"Exactly. So perhaps I might be too frank."');
lines.push('Bill had dropped down on the grass, and Cayley took his place on the');
lines.push('seat, and sat there heavily, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his');
lines.push('hands, gazing at the ground.');
lines.push('"I want you to be quite frank," he said at last. "Naturally I am');
lines.push('prejudiced where Mark is concerned. So I want to know how my suggestion');
lines.push('strikes you who have no prejudices either way."');
lines.push('"Your suggestion?"');
lines.push('"My theory that, if Mark killed his brother, it was purely accidental as');
lines.push('I told the Inspector."');
lines.push('Bill looked up with interest.');
lines.push('"You mean that Robert did the hold-up business," he said, "and there was');
lines.push('a bit of a struggle, and the revolver went off, and then Mark lost his');
lines.push('head and bolted? That sort of idea?"');
lines.push('"Exactly."');
lines.push('"Well, that seems all right." He turned to Antony. "There\'s nothing');
lines.push('wrong with that, is there? It\'s the most natural explanation to anyone');
lines.push('who knows Mark."');
lines.push('Antony pulled at his pipe.');
lines.push('"I suppose it is," he said slowly. "But there\'s one thing that worries');
lines.push('me rather."');
lines.push('"What\'s that?" Bill and Cayley asked the question simultaneously.');
lines.push('"The key."');
lines.push('"The key?" said Bill.');
lines.push('Cayley lifted his head and looked at Antony. "What about the key?" he');
lines.push('asked.');
lines.push('"Well, there may be nothing in it; I just wondered. Suppose Robert was');
lines.push('killed as you say, and suppose Mark lost his head and thought of nothing');
lines.push('but getting away before anyone could see him. Well, very likely');
lines.push('he\'d lock the door and put the key in his pocket. He\'d do it without');
lines.push('thinking, just to gain a moment\'s time."');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s what I suggest."');
lines.push('"It seems sound enough," said Bill. "Sort of thing you\'d do without');
lines.push('thinking. Besides, if you are going to run away, it gives you more of a');
lines.push('chance."');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s all right if the key is there. But suppose it isn\'t there?"');
lines.push('The suggestion, made as if it were already an established fact, startled');
lines.push('them both. They looked at him wonderingly.');
lines.push('"What do you mean?" said Cayley.');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s just a question of where people happen to keep their keys.');
lines.push('You go up to your bedroom, and perhaps you like to lock your door in');
lines.push('case anybody comes wandering in when you\'ve only got one sock and a pair');
lines.push('of braces on. Well, that\'s natural enough. And if you look round the');
lines.push('bedrooms of almost any house, you\'ll find the keys all ready, so that');
lines.push('you can lock yourself in at a moment\'s notice. But downstairs people');
lines.push('don\'t lock themselves in. It\'s really never done at all. Bill, for');
lines.push('instance, has never locked himself into the dining-room in order to be');
lines.push('alone with the sherry. On the other hand, all women, and particularly');
lines.push('servants, have a horror of burglars. And if a burglar gets in by the');
lines.push('window, they like to limit his activities to that particular room. So');
lines.push('they keep the keys on the outside of the doors, and lock the doors when');
lines.push('they go to bed." He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and added, "At');
lines.push('least, my mother always used to."');
lines.push('"You mean," said Bill excitedly, "that the key was on the outside of the');
lines.push('door when Mark went into the room?"');
lines.push('"Well, I was just wondering."');
lines.push('"Have you noticed the other rooms--the billiard-room, and library, and so');
lines.push('on?" said Cayley.');
lines.push('"I\'ve only just thought about it while I\'ve been sitting out here. You');
lines.push('live here--haven\'t you ever noticed them?"');
lines.push('Cayley sat considering, with his head on one side.');
lines.push('"It seems rather absurd, you know, but I can\'t say that I have." He');
lines.push('turned to Bill. "Have you?"');
lines.push('"Good Lord, no. I should never worry about a thing like that."');
lines.push('"I\'m sure you wouldn\'t," laughed Antony. "Well, we can have a look when');
lines.push('we go in. If the other keys are outside, then this one was probably');
lines.push('outside too, and in that case well, it makes it more interesting."');
lines.push('Cayley said nothing. Bill chewed a piece of grass, and then said, "Does');
lines.push('it make much difference?"');
lines.push('"It makes it more hard to understand what happened in there. Take your');
lines.push('accidental theory and see where you get to. No instinctive turning of');
lines.push('the key now, is there? He\'s got to open the door to get it, and opening');
lines.push('the door means showing his head to anybody in the hall--his cousin, for');
lines.push('instance, whom he left there two minutes ago. Is a man in Mark\'s state');
lines.push('of mind, frightened to death lest he should be found with the body,');
lines.push('going to do anything so foolhardy as that?"');
lines.push('"He needn\'t have been afraid of me," said Cayley.');
lines.push('"Then why didn\'t he call for you? He knew you were about. You could');
lines.push('have advised him; Heaven knows he wanted advice. But the whole theory');
lines.push('of Mark\'s escape is that he was afraid of you and of everybody else,');
lines.push('and that he had no other idea but to get out of the room himself, and');
lines.push('prevent you or the servants from coming into it. If the key had been on');
lines.push('the inside, he would probably have locked the door. If it were on the');
lines.push('outside, he almost certainly wouldn\'t."');
lines.push('"Yes, I expect you\'re right," said Bill thoughtfully. "Unless he took');
lines.push('the key in with him, and locked the door at once."');
lines.push('"Exactly. But in that case you have to build up a new theory entirely."');
lines.push('"You mean that it makes it seem more deliberate?"');
lines.push('"Yes; that, certainly. But it also seems to make Mark out an absolute');
lines.push('idiot. Just suppose for a moment that, for urgent reasons which neither');
lines.push('of you know anything about, he had wished to get rid of his brother.');
lines.push('Would he have done it like that? Just killed him and then run away? Why,');
lines.push('that\'s practically suicide--suicide whilst of unsound mind. No. If you');
lines.push('really wanted to remove an undesirable brother, you would do it a little');
lines.push('bit more cleverly than that. You\'d begin by treating him as a friend, so');
lines.push('as to avoid suspicion, and when you did kill him at last, you would try');
lines.push('to make it look like an accident, or suicide, or the work of some other');
lines.push('man. Wouldn\'t you?"');
lines.push('"You mean you\'d give yourself a bit of a run for your money?"');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s what I mean. If you were going to do it deliberately, that');
lines.push('is to say and lock yourself in before you began."');
lines.push('Cayley had been silent, apparently thinking over this new idea. With his');
lines.push('eyes still on the ground, he said now: "I hold to my opinion that it was');
lines.push('purely accidental, and that Mark lost his head and ran away."');
lines.push('"But what about the key?" asked Bill.');
lines.push('"We don\'t know yet that the keys were outside. I don\'t at all agree with');
lines.push('Mr. Gillingham that the keys of the down-stairs rooms are always outside');
lines.push('the doors. Sometimes they are, no doubt; but I think we shall probably');
lines.push('find that these are inside."');
lines.push('"Oh, well, of course, if they are inside, then your original theory');
lines.push('is probably the correct one. Having often seen them outside, I just');
lines.push('wondered that\'s all. You asked me to be quite frank, you know, and tell');
lines.push('you what I thought. But no doubt you\'re right, and we shall find them');
lines.push('inside, as you say.');
lines.push('"Even if the key was outside," went on Cayley stubbornly, "I still');
lines.push('think it might have been accidental. He might have taken it in with him,');
lines.push('knowing that the interview would be an unpleasant one, and not wishing');
lines.push('to be interrupted."');
lines.push('"But he had just told you to stand by in case he wanted you; so why');
lines.push('should he lock you out? Besides, I should think that if a man were going');
lines.push('to have an unpleasant interview with a threatening relation, the last');
lines.push('thing he would do would be to barricade himself in with him. He would');
lines.push('want to open all the doors and say, \'Get out of it\'"');
lines.push('Cayley was silent, but his mouth looked obstinate. Antony gave a little');
lines.push('apologetic laugh and stood up.');
lines.push('"Well, come on, Bill," he said; "we ought to be stepping." He held out a');
lines.push('hand and pulled his friend up. Then, turning to Cayley, he went on, "You');
lines.push('must forgive me if I have let my thoughts run on rather. Of course, I');
lines.push('was considering the matter purely as an outsider; just as a problem, I');
lines.push('mean, which didn\'t concern the happiness of any of my friends."');
lines.push('"That\'s all right, Mr. Gillingham," said Cayley, standing up too. "It');
lines.push('is for you to make allowances for me. I\'m sure you will. You say that');
lines.push('you\'re going up to the inn now about your bag?"');
lines.push('"Yes." He looked up at the sun and then round the parkland stretching');
lines.push('about the house. "Let me see; it\'s over in that direction, isn\'t it?" He');
lines.push('pointed southwards. "Can we get to the village that way, or must we go');
lines.push('by the road?"');
lines.push('"I\'ll show you, my boy," said Bill.');
lines.push('"Bill will show you. The park reaches almost as far as the village. Then');
lines.push('I\'ll send the car round in about half an hour."');
lines.push('"Thanks very much."');
lines.push('Cayley nodded and turned to go into the house. Antony took hold of');
lines.push('Bill\'s arm and walked off with him in the opposite direction.');
lines.push('CHAPTER VII. Portrait of a Gentleman');
lines.push('They walked in silence for a little, until they had left the house and');
lines.push('gardens well behind them. In front of them and to the right the park');
lines.push('dipped and then rose slowly, shutting out the rest of the world. A thick');
lines.push('belt of trees on the left divided them from the main road.');
lines.push('"Ever been here before?" said Antony suddenly.');
lines.push('"Oh, rather. Dozens of times."');
lines.push('"I meant just here where we are now. Or do you stay indoors and play');
lines.push('billiards all the time?"');
lines.push('"Oh Lord, no!"');
lines.push('"Well, tennis and things. So many people with beautiful parks never by');
lines.push('any chance use them, and all the poor devils passing by on the dusty');
lines.push('road think how lucky the owners are to have them, and imagine them doing');
lines.push('all sorts of jolly things inside." He pointed to the right. "Ever been');
lines.push('over there?"');
lines.push('Bill laughed, as if a little ashamed.');
lines.push('"Well, not very much. I\'ve often been along here, of course, because');
lines.push('it\'s the short way to the village."');
lines.push('"Yes.... All right; now tell me something about Mark."');
lines.push('"What sort of things?"');
lines.push('"Well, never mind about his being your host, or about your being a');
lines.push('perfect gentleman, or anything like that. Cut out the Manners for Men,');
lines.push('and tell me what you think of Mark, and how you like staying with him,');
lines.push('and how many rows your little house-party has had this week, and how you');
lines.push('get on with Cayley, and all the rest of it."');
lines.push('Bill looked at him eagerly.');
lines.push('"I say, are you being the complete detective?"');
lines.push('"Well, I wanted a new profession," smiled the other.');
lines.push('"What fun! I mean," he corrected himself apologetically, "one oughtn\'t');
lines.push('to say that, when there\'s a man dead in the house, and one\'s host--"');
lines.push('He broke off a little uncertainly, and then rounded off his period by');
lines.push('saying again, "By Jove, what a rum show it is. Good Lord!"');
lines.push('"Well?" said Antony. "Carry on, Mark."');
lines.push('"What do I think of him?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('Bill was silent, wondering how to put into words thoughts which had');
lines.push('never formed themselves very definitely in his own mind. What did he');
lines.push('think of Mark? Seeing his hesitation, Antony said:');
lines.push('"I ought to have warned you that nothing that you say will be taken down');
lines.push('by the reporters, so you needn\'t bother about a split infinitive or two.');
lines.push('Talk about anything you like, how you like. Well, I\'ll give you a start.');
lines.push('Which do you enjoy more a week-end here or at the Barrington\'s, say?"');
lines.push('"Well; of course, that would depend--"');
lines.push('"Take it that she was there in both cases."');
lines.push('"Ass," said Bill, putting an elbow into Antony\'s ribs. "It\'s a little');
lines.push('difficult to say," he went on. "Of course they do you awfully well');
lines.push('here."');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"I don\'t think I know any house where things are so comfortable. One\'s');
lines.push('room--the food--drinks--cigars--the way everything\'s arranged: All that');
lines.push('sort of thing. They look after you awfully well."');
lines.push('"Yes?"');
lines.push('"Yes." He repeated it slowly to himself, as if it had given him a new');
lines.push('idea: "They look after you awfully well. Well, that\'s just what it is');
lines.push('about Mark. That\'s one of his little ways. Weaknesses. Looking after');
lines.push('you."');
lines.push('"Arranging things for you?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Of course, it\'s a delightful house, and there\'s plenty to do, and');
lines.push('opportunities for every game or sport that\'s ever been invented, and,');
lines.push('as I say, one gets awfully well done; but with it all, Tony, there\'s');
lines.push('a faint sort of feeling that well, that one is on parade, as it were.');
lines.push('You\'ve got to do as you\'re told."');
lines.push('"How do you mean?"');
lines.push('"Well, Mark fancies himself rather at arranging things. He arranges');
lines.push('things, and it\'s understood that the guests fall in with the');
lines.push('arrangement. For instance, Betty--Miss Calladine--and I were going to');
lines.push('play a single just before tea, the other day. Tennis. She\'s frightfully');
lines.push('hot stuff at tennis, and backed herself to take me on level. I\'m rather');
lines.push('erratic, you know. Mark saw us going out with our rackets and asked us');
lines.push('what we were going to do. Well, he\'d got up a little tournament for');
lines.push('us after tea--handicaps all arranged by him, and everything ruled out');
lines.push('neatly in red and black ink--prizes and all--quite decent ones, you');
lines.push('know. He\'d had the lawn specially cut and marked for it. Well, of course');
lines.push('Betty and I wouldn\'t have spoilt the court, and we\'d have been quite');
lines.push('ready to play again after tea--I had to give her half-fifteen according');
lines.push('to his handicap--but somehow--" Bill stopped and shrugged his shoulders.');
lines.push('"It didn\'t quite fit in?"');
lines.push('"No. It spoilt the effect of his tournament. Took the edge off it just');
lines.push('a little, I suppose he felt. So we didn\'t play." He laughed, and added,');
lines.push('"It would have been as much as our place was worth to have played."');
lines.push('"Do you mean you wouldn\'t have been asked here again?"');
lines.push('"Probably. Well, I don\'t know. Not for some time, anyway."');
lines.push('"Really, Bill?"');
lines.push('"Oh, rather! He\'s a devil for taking offence. That Miss Norris, did you');
lines.push('see her? She\'s done for herself. I don\'t mind betting what you like that');
lines.push('she never comes here again."');
lines.push('"Why?"');
lines.push('Bill laughed to himself.');
lines.push('"We were all in it, really--at least, Betty and I were. There\'s supposed');
lines.push('to be a ghost attached to the house. Lady Anne Patten. Ever heard of');
lines.push('her?"');
lines.push('"Never."');
lines.push('"Mark told us about her at dinner one night. He rather liked the idea');
lines.push('of there being a ghost in his house, you know; except that he doesn\'t');
lines.push('believe in ghosts. I think he wanted all of us to believe in her, and');
lines.push('yet he was annoyed with Betty and Mrs. Calladine for believing in ghosts');
lines.push('at all. Rum chap. Well, anyhow, Miss Norris--she\'s an actress, some');
lines.push('actress too--dressed up as the ghost and played the fool a bit. And poor');
lines.push('Mark was frightened out of his life. Just for a moment, you know."');
lines.push('"What about the others?"');
lines.push('"Well, Betty and I knew; in fact, I\'d told her--Miss Norris I mean--not');
lines.push('to be a silly ass. Knowing Mark. Mrs. Calladine wasn\'t there--Betty');
lines.push('wouldn\'t let her be. As for the Major, I don\'t believe anything would');
lines.push('frighten him."');
lines.push('"Where did the ghost appear?"');
lines.push('"Down by the bowling-green. That\'s supposed to be its haunt, you know.');
lines.push('We were all down there in the moonlight, pretending to wait for it. Do');
lines.push('you know the bowling-green?"');
lines.push('"No."');
lines.push('"I\'ll show it to you after dinner."');
lines.push('"I wish you would.... Was Mark very angry afterwards?"');
lines.push('"Oh, Lord, yes. Sulked for a whole day. Well, he\'s just like that."');
lines.push('"Was he angry with all of you?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes sulky, you know."');
lines.push('"This morning?"');
lines.push('"Oh, no. He got over it he generally does. He\'s just like a child.');
lines.push('That\'s really it, Tony; he\'s like a child in some ways. As a matter of');
lines.push('fact, he was unusually bucked with himself this morning. And yesterday."');
lines.push('"Yesterday?"');
lines.push('"Rather. We all said we\'d never seen him in such form."');
lines.push('"Is he generally in form?"');
lines.push('"He\'s quite good company, you know, if you take him the right way.');
lines.push('He\'s rather vain and childish well, like I\'ve been telling you and');
lines.push('self-important; but quite amusing in his way, and--" Bill broke off');
lines.push('suddenly. "I say, you know, it really is the limit, talking about your');
lines.push('host like this."');
lines.push('"Don\'t think of him as your host. Think of him as a suspected murderer');
lines.push('with a warrant out against him."');
lines.push('"Oh! but that\'s all rot, you know."');
lines.push('"It\'s the fact, Bill."');
lines.push('"Yes, but I mean, he didn\'t do it. He wouldn\'t murder anybody. It\'s a');
lines.push('funny thing to say, but well, he\'s not big enough for it. He\'s got his');
lines.push('faults, like all of us, but they aren\'t on that scale."');
lines.push('"One can kill anybody in a childish fit of temper."');
lines.push('Bill grunted assent, but without prejudice to Mark. "All the same," he');
lines.push('said, "I can\'t believe it. That he would do it deliberately, I mean."');
lines.push('"Suppose it was an accident, as Cayley says, would he lose his head and');
lines.push('run away?"');
lines.push('Bill considered for a moment.');
lines.push('"Yes, I really think he might, you know. He nearly ran away when he saw');
lines.push('the ghost. Of course, that\'s different, rather."');
lines.push('"Oh, I don\'t know. In each case it\'s a question of obeying your instinct');
lines.push('instead of your reason."');
lines.push('They had left the open land and were following a path through the');
lines.push('bordering trees. Two abreast was uncomfortable, so Antony dropped');
lines.push('behind, and further conversation was postponed until they were outside');
lines.push('the boundary fence and in the high road. The road sloped gently down to');
lines.push('the village of Waldheim a few red-roofed cottages, and the grey tower of');
lines.push('a church showing above the green.');
lines.push('"Well, now," said Antony, as they stepped out more quickly, "what about');
lines.push('Cayley?"');
lines.push('"How do you mean, what about him?"');
lines.push('"I want to see him. I can see Mark perfectly, thanks to you, Bill. You');
lines.push('were wonderful. Now let\'s have Cayley\'s character. Cayley from within."');
lines.push('Bill laughed in pleased embarrassment, and protested that he was not a');
lines.push('blooming novelist.');
lines.push('"Besides," he added, "Mark\'s easy. Cayley\'s one of these heavy, quiet');
lines.push('people, who might be thinking about anything. Mark gives himself');
lines.push('away.... Ugly, black-jawed devil, isn\'t he?"');
lines.push('"Some women like that type of ugliness."');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s true. Between ourselves, I think there\'s one here who does.');
lines.push('Rather a pretty girl at Jallands" he waved his left hand "down that');
lines.push('way."');
lines.push('"What\'s Jallands?"');
lines.push('"Well, I suppose it used to be a farm, belonging to a bloke called');
lines.push('Jalland, but now it\'s a country cottage belonging to a widow called');
lines.push('Norbury. Mark and Cayley used to go there a good deal together. Miss');
lines.push('Norbury--the girl--has been here once or twice for tennis; seemed to');
lines.push('prefer Cayley to the rest of us. But of course he hadn\'t much time for');
lines.push('that sort of thing."');
lines.push('"What sort of thing?"');
lines.push('"Walking about with a pretty girl and asking her if she\'s been to any');
lines.push('theatres lately. He nearly always had something to do."');
lines.push('"Mark kept him busy?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Mark never seemed quite happy unless he had Cayley doing something');
lines.push('for him. He was quite lost and helpless without him. And, funnily');
lines.push('enough, Cayley seemed lost without Mark."');
lines.push('"He was fond of him?"');
lines.push('"Yes, I should say so. In a protective kind of way. He\'d sized Mark up,');
lines.push('of course his vanity, his self-importance, his amateurishness and all');
lines.push('the rest of it but he liked looking after him. And he knew how to manage');
lines.push('him."');
lines.push('"Yes.... What sort of terms was he on with the guests--you and Miss');
lines.push('Norris and all of them?"');
lines.push('"Just polite and rather silent, you know. Keeping himself to himself. We');
lines.push('didn\'t see so very much of him, except at meals. We were here to enjoy');
lines.push('ourselves, and well, he wasn\'t."');
lines.push('"He wasn\'t there when the ghost walked?"');
lines.push('"No. I heard Mark calling for him when he went back to the house. I');
lines.push('expect Cayley stroked down his feathers a bit, and told him that girls');
lines.push('will be girls....--Hallo, here we are."');
lines.push('They went into the inn, and while Bill made himself pleasant to the');
lines.push('landlady, Antony went upstairs to his room. It appeared that he had not');
lines.push('very much packing to do, after all. He returned his brushes to his bag,');
lines.push('glanced round to see that nothing else had been taken out, and went down');
lines.push('again to settle his bill. He had decided to keep on his room for a few');
lines.push('days; partly to save the landlord and his wife the disappointment of');
lines.push('losing a guest so suddenly, partly in case he found it undesirable later');
lines.push('on to remain at the Red House. For he was taking himself seriously as a');
lines.push('detective; indeed, he took himself seriously (while getting all the fun');
lines.push('out of it which was possible) at every new profession he adopted; and he');
lines.push('felt that there might come a time after the inquest, say when he could');
lines.push('not decently remain at the Red House as a guest, a friend of Bill\'s,');
lines.push('enjoying the hospitality of Mark or Cayley, whichever was to be regarded');
lines.push('as his host, without forfeiting his independent attitude towards the');
lines.push('events of that afternoon. At present he was staying in the house merely');
lines.push('as a necessary witness, and, since he was there, Cayley could not object');
lines.push('to him using his eyes; but if, after the inquest, it appeared that there');
lines.push('was still work for a pair of independent and very keen eyes to do, then');
lines.push('he must investigate, either with his host\'s approval or from beneath the');
lines.push('roof of some other host; the landlord of \'The George,\' for instance, who');
lines.push('had no feelings in the matter.');
lines.push('For of one thing Antony was certain. Cayley knew more than he professed');
lines.push('to know. That is to say, he knew more than he wanted other people to');
lines.push('know he knew. Antony was one of the "other people"; if, therefore, he');
lines.push('was for trying to find out what it was that Cayley knew, he could hardly');
lines.push('expect Cayley\'s approval of his labours. It would be \'The George,\' then,');
lines.push('for Antony after the inquest.');
lines.push('What was the truth? Not necessarily discreditable to Cayley, even though');
lines.push('he were hiding something. All that could be said against him at the');
lines.push('moment was that he had gone the longest way round to get into the locked');
lines.push('office and that this did not fit in with what he had told the Inspector.');
lines.push('But it did fit in with the theory that he had been an accessory after');
lines.push('the event, and that he wanted (while appearing to be in a hurry) to give');
lines.push('his cousin as much time as possible in which to escape. That might not');
lines.push('be the true solution, but it was at least a workable one. The theory');
lines.push('which he had suggested to the Inspector was not.');
lines.push('However, there would be a day or two before the inquest, in which Antony');
lines.push('could consider all these matters from within The Red House. The car was');
lines.push('at the door. He got in with Bill, the landlord put his bag on the front');
lines.push('seat next to the chauffeur, and they drove back.');
lines.push('CHAPTER VIII. "Do You Follow Me, Watson?"');
lines.push('Anthony\'s bedroom looked over the park at the back of the house. The');
lines.push('blinds were not yet drawn while he was changing his clothes for dinner,');
lines.push('and at various stages of undress he would pause and gaze out of the');
lines.push('window, sometimes smiling to himself, sometimes frowning, as he turned');
lines.push('over in his mind all the strange things that he had seen that day. He');
lines.push('was sitting on his bed, in shirt and trousers, absently smoothing down');
lines.push('his thick black hair with his brushes, when Bill shouted an "Hallo!"');
lines.push('through the door, and came in.');
lines.push('"I say, buck up, old boy, I\'m hungry," he said.');
lines.push('Antony stopped smoothing himself and looked up at him thoughtfully.');
lines.push('"Where\'s Mark?" he said.');
lines.push('"Mark? You mean Cayley."');
lines.push('Antony corrected himself with a little laugh. "Yes, I mean Cayley. Is');
lines.push('he down? I say, I shan\'t be a moment, Bill." He got up from the bed and');
lines.push('went on briskly with his dressing. "Oh, by the way," said Bill, taking');
lines.push('his place on the bed, "your idea about the keys is a wash-out."');
lines.push('"Why, how do you mean?"');
lines.push('"I went down just now and had a look at them. We were asses not to have');
lines.push('thought of it when we came in. The library key is outside, but all the');
lines.push('others are inside."');
lines.push('"Yes, I know."');
lines.push('"You devil, I suppose you did think of it, then?"');
lines.push('"I did, Bill," said Antony apologetically.');
lines.push('"Bother! I hoped you\'d forgotten. Well, that knocks your theory on the');
lines.push('head, doesn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"I never had a theory. I only said that if they were outside, it would');
lines.push('probably mean that the office key was outside, and that in that case');
lines.push('Cayley\'s theory was knocked on the head."');
lines.push('"Well, now, it isn\'t, and we don\'t know anything. Some were outside and');
lines.push('some inside, and there you are. It makes it much less exciting. When you');
lines.push('were talking about it on the lawn, I really got quite keen on the idea');
lines.push('of the key being outside and Mark taking it in with him."');
lines.push('"It\'s going to be exciting enough," said Antony mildly, as he');
lines.push('transferred his pipe and tobacco into the pocket of his black coat.');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s come down; I\'m ready now."');
lines.push('Cayley was waiting for them in the hall. He made some polite inquiry');
lines.push('as to the guest\'s comfort, and the three of them fell into a casual');
lines.push('conversation about houses in general and The Red House in particular.');
lines.push('"You were quite right about the keys," said Bill, during a pause. He was');
lines.push('less able than the other two, perhaps because he was younger than they,');
lines.push('to keep away from the subject which was uppermost in the minds of them');
lines.push('all.');
lines.push('"Keys?" said Cayley blankly.');
lines.push('"We were wondering whether they were outside or inside."');
lines.push('"Oh! oh, yes!" He looked slowly round the hall, at the different doors,');
lines.push('and then smiled in a friendly way at Antony. "We both seem to have been');
lines.push('right, Mr. Gillingham. So we don\'t get much farther."');
lines.push('"No." He gave a shrug. "I just wondered, you know. I thought it was');
lines.push('worth mentioning."');
lines.push('"Oh, quite. Not that you would have convinced me, you know. Just as');
lines.push('Elsie\'s evidence doesn\'t convince me."');
lines.push('"Elsie?" said Bill excitedly. Antony looked inquiringly at him,');
lines.push('wondering who Elsie was.');
lines.push('"One of the housemaids," explained Cayley. "You didn\'t hear what she');
lines.push('told the Inspector? Of course, as I told Birch, girls of that class make');
lines.push('things up, but he seemed to think she was genuine."');
lines.push('"What was it?" said Bill.');
lines.push('Cayley told them of what Elsie had heard through the office door that');
lines.push('afternoon.');
lines.push('"You were in the library then, of course," said Antony, rather to');
lines.push('himself than to the other. "She might have gone through the hall without');
lines.push('your hearing."');
lines.push('"Oh, I\'ve no doubt she was there, and heard voices. Perhaps heard those');
lines.push('very words. But--" He broke off, and then added impatiently, "It was');
lines.push('accidental. I know it was accidental. What\'s the good of talking as if');
lines.push('Mark was a murderer?" Dinner was announced at that moment, and as they');
lines.push('went in, he added, "What\'s the good of talking about it at all, if it');
lines.push('comes to that?"');
lines.push('"What, indeed?" said Antony, and to Bill\'s great disappointment they');
lines.push('talked of books and politics during the meal.');
lines.push('Cayley made an excuse for leaving them as soon as their cigars were');
lines.push('alight. He had business to attend to, as was natural. Bill would look');
lines.push('after his friend. Bill was only too willing. He offered to beat');
lines.push('Antony at billiards, to play him at piquet, to show him the garden by');
lines.push('moonlight, or indeed to do anything else with him that he required.');
lines.push('"Thank the Lord you\'re here," he said piously. "I couldn\'t have stood it');
lines.push('alone."');
lines.push('"Let\'s go outside," suggested Antony. "It\'s quite warm. Somewhere where');
lines.push('we can sit down, right away from the house. I want to talk to you."');
lines.push('"Good man. What about the bowling-green?"');
lines.push('"Oh, you were going to show me that, anyhow, weren\'t you? Is it');
lines.push('somewhere where we can talk without being overheard?"');
lines.push('"Rather. The ideal place. You\'ll see."');
lines.push('They came out of the front door and followed the drive to the left.');
lines.push('Coming from Waldheim, Antony had approached the house that afternoon');
lines.push('from the other side. The way they were going now would take them out');
lines.push('at the opposite end of the park, on the high road to Stanton, a country');
lines.push('town some three miles away. They passed by a gate and a gardener\'s');
lines.push('lodge, which marked the limit of what auctioneers like to call "the');
lines.push('ornamental grounds of the estate," and then the open park was before');
lines.push('them.');
lines.push('"Sure we haven\'t missed it?" said Antony. The park lay quietly in the');
lines.push('moonlight on either side of the drive, wearing a little way ahead');
lines.push('of them a deceptive air of smoothness which retreated always as they');
lines.push('advanced.');
lines.push('"Rum, isn\'t it?" said Bill. "An absurd place for a bowling green, but I');
lines.push('suppose it was always here."');
lines.push('"Yes, but always where? It\'s short enough for golf, perhaps,');
lines.push('but--Hallo!"');
lines.push('They had come to the place. The road bent round to the right, but they');
lines.push('kept straight on over a broad grass path for twenty yards, and there');
lines.push('in front of them was the green. A dry ditch, ten feet wide and six');
lines.push('feet deep, surrounded it, except in the one place where the path went');
lines.push('forward. Two or three grass steps led down to the green, on which there');
lines.push('was a long wooden beach for the benefit of spectators.');
lines.push('"Yes, it hides itself very nicely," said Antony. "Where do you keep the');
lines.push('bowls?"');
lines.push('"In a sort of summer house place. Round here."');
lines.push('They walked along the edge of the green until they came to it a low');
lines.push('wooden bunk which had been built into one wall of the ditch.');
lines.push('"H\'m. Jolly view."');
lines.push('Bill laughed.');
lines.push('"Nobody sits there. It\'s just for keeping things out of the rain."');
lines.push('They finished their circuit of the green "Just in case anybody\'s in the');
lines.push('ditch," said Antony and then sat down on the bench.');
lines.push('"Now then," said Bill, "We are alone. Fire ahead."');
lines.push('Antony smoked thoughtfully for a little. Then he took his pipe out of');
lines.push('his mouth and turned to his friend.');
lines.push('"Are you prepared to be the complete Watson?" he asked.');
lines.push('"Watson?"');
lines.push('"Do-you-follow-me-Watson; that one. Are you prepared to have quite');
lines.push('obvious things explained to you, to ask futile questions, to give me');
lines.push('chances of scoring off you, to make brilliant discoveries of your own');
lines.push('two or three days after I have made them myself all that kind of thing?');
lines.push('Because it all helps."');
lines.push('"My dear Tony," said Bill delightedly, "need you ask?" Antony said');
lines.push('nothing, and Bill went on happily to himself, "I perceive from the');
lines.push('strawberry-mark on your shirt-front that you had strawberries for');
lines.push('dessert. Holmes, you astonish me. Tut, tut, you know my methods. Where');
lines.push('is the tobacco? The tobacco is in the Persian slipper. Can I leave my');
lines.push('practice for a week? I can."');
lines.push('Antony smiled and went on smoking. After waiting hopefully for a minute');
lines.push('or two, Bill said in a firm voice:');
lines.push('"Well then, Holmes, I feel bound to ask you if you have deduced');
lines.push('anything. Also whom do you suspect?"');
lines.push('Antony began to talk.');
lines.push('"Do you remember," he said, "one of Holmes\'s little scores over Watson');
lines.push('about the number of steps up to the Baker Street lodging? Poor old');
lines.push('Watson had been up and down them a thousand times, but he had never');
lines.push('thought of counting them, whereas Holmes had counted them as a matter of');
lines.push('course, and knew that there were seventeen. And that was supposed to');
lines.push('be the difference between observation and non-observation. Watson was');
lines.push('crushed again, and Holmes appeared to him more amazing than ever. Now,');
lines.push('it always seemed to me that in that matter Holmes was the ass, and');
lines.push('Watson the sensible person. What on earth is the point of keeping in');
lines.push('your head an unnecessary fact like that? If you really want to know');
lines.push('at any time the number of steps to your lodging, you can ring up your');
lines.push('landlady and ask her. I\'ve been up and down the steps of the club a');
lines.push('thousand times, but if you asked me to tell you at this moment how many');
lines.push('steps there are I couldn\'t do it. Could you?"');
lines.push('"I certainly couldn\'t," said Bill.');
lines.push('"But if you really wanted to know," said Antony casually, with a sudden');
lines.push('change of voice, "I could find out for you without even bothering to');
lines.push('ring up the hall-porter."');
lines.push('Bill was puzzled as to why they were talking about the club steps, but');
lines.push('he felt it his duty to say that he did want to know how many they were.');
lines.push('"Right," said Antony. "I\'ll find out."');
lines.push('He closed his eyes.');
lines.push('"I\'m walking up St James\' Street," he said slowly. "Now I\'ve come to the');
lines.push('club and I\'m going past the smoking-room--windows-one-two three');
lines.push('four. Now I\'m at the steps. I turn in and begin going up them.');
lines.push('One-two-three-four-five-six, then a broad step; six-seven-eight-nine,');
lines.push('another broad step; nine-ten-eleven. Eleven I\'m inside. Good morning,');
lines.push('Rogers. Fine day again." With a little start he opened his eyes and came');
lines.push('back again to his present surroundings. He turned to Bill with a smile.');
lines.push('"Eleven," he said. "Count them the next time you\'re there. Eleven and');
lines.push('now I hope I shall forget it again."');
lines.push('Bill was distinctly interested.');
lines.push('"That\'s rather hot," he said. "Expound."');
lines.push('"Well, I can\'t explain it, whether it\'s something in the actual eye, or');
lines.push('something in the brain, or what, but I have got rather an uncanny habit');
lines.push('of recording things unconsciously. You know that game where you look at');
lines.push('a tray full of small objects for three minutes, and then turn away and');
lines.push('try to make a list of them. It means a devil of a lot of concentration');
lines.push('for the ordinary person, if he wants to get his list complete, but in');
lines.push('some odd way I manage to do it without concentration at all. I mean that');
lines.push('my eyes seem to do it without the brain consciously taking any part. I');
lines.push('could look at the tray, for instance, and talk to you about golf at the');
lines.push('same time, and still get my list right."');
lines.push('"I should think that\'s rather a useful gift for an amateur detective.');
lines.push('You ought to have gone into the profession before."');
lines.push('"Well, it is rather useful. It\'s rather surprising, you know, to a');
lines.push('stranger. Let\'s surprise Cayley with it, shall we?"');
lines.push('"How?"');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s ask him--" Antony stopped and looked at Bill comically,');
lines.push('"let\'s ask him what he\'s going to do with the key of the office."');
lines.push('For a moment Bill did not understand.');
lines.push('"Key of the office?" he said vaguely. "You don\'t mean--Tony! What do you');
lines.push('mean? Good God! do you mean that Cayley--But what about Mark?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t know where Mark is--that\'s another thing I want to know--but');
lines.push('I\'m quite certain that he hasn\'t got the key of the office with him.');
lines.push('Because Cayley\'s got it."');
lines.push('"Are you sure?"');
lines.push('"Quite."');
lines.push('Bill looked at him wonderingly.');
lines.push('"I say," he said, almost pleadingly, "don\'t tell me that you can see');
lines.push('into people\'s pockets and all that sort of thing as well."');
lines.push('Antony laughed and denied it cheerfully.');
lines.push('"Then how do you know?"');
lines.push('"You\'re the perfect Watson, Bill. You take to it quite naturally.');
lines.push('Properly speaking, I oughtn\'t to explain till the last chapter, but I');
lines.push('always think that that\'s so unfair. So here goes. Of course, I don\'t');
lines.push('really know that he\'s got it, but I do know that he had it. I know that');
lines.push('when I came on him this afternoon, he had just locked the door and put');
lines.push('the key in his pocket."');
lines.push('"You mean you saw him at the time, but that you\'ve only just remembered');
lines.push('it--reconstructed it in the way you were explaining just now?"');
lines.push('"No. I didn\'t see him. But I did see something. I saw the key of the');
lines.push('billiard-room."');
lines.push('"Where?');
lines.push('"Outside the billiard-room door."');
lines.push('"Outside? But it was inside when we looked just now."');
lines.push('"Exactly."');
lines.push('"Who put it there?"');
lines.push('"Obviously Cayley."');
lines.push('"But--"');
lines.push('"Let\'s go back to this afternoon. I don\'t remember noticing the');
lines.push('billiard-room key at the time; I must have done so without knowing.');
lines.push('Probably when I saw Cayley banging at the door I may have wondered');
lines.push('subconsciously whether the key of the room next to it would fit.');
lines.push('Something like that, I daresay. Well, when I was sitting out by myself');
lines.push('on that seat just before you came along, I went over the whole scene in');
lines.push('my mind, and I suddenly saw the billiard-room key there outside. And I');
lines.push('began to wonder if the office-key had been outside too. When Cayley came');
lines.push('up, I told you my idea and you were both interested. But Cayley was just');
lines.push('a shade too interested. I daresay you didn\'t notice it, but he was."');
lines.push('"By Jove!"');
lines.push('"Well, of course that proved nothing; and the key business didn\'t really');
lines.push('prove anything, because whatever side of the door the other keys were,');
lines.push('Mark might have locked his own private room from the inside sometimes.');
lines.push('But I piled it on, and pretended that it was enormously important, and');
lines.push('quite altered the case altogether, and having got Cayley thoroughly');
lines.push('anxious about it, I told him that we should be well out of the way for');
lines.push('the next hour or so, and that he would be alone in the house to do what');
lines.push('he liked about it. And, as I expected, he couldn\'t resist it. He altered');
lines.push('the keys and gave himself away entirely."');
lines.push('"But the library key was still outside. Why didn\'t he alter that?"');
lines.push('"Because he\'s a clever devil. For one thing, the Inspector had been');
lines.push('in the library, and might possibly have noticed it already. And for');
lines.push('another--" Antony hesitated.');
lines.push('"What?" said Bill, after waiting for him to go on.');
lines.push('"It\'s only guesswork. But I fancy that Cayley was thoroughly upset about');
lines.push('the key business. He suddenly realized that he had been careless, and');
lines.push('he hadn\'t got time to think it all over. So he didn\'t want to commit');
lines.push('himself definitely to the statement that the key was either outside or');
lines.push('inside. He wanted to leave it vague. It was safest that way."');
lines.push('"I see," said Bill slowly.');
lines.push('But his mind was elsewhere. He was wondering suddenly about Cayley.');
lines.push('Cayley was just an ordinary man--like himself. Bill had had little jokes');
lines.push('with him sometimes; not that Cayley was much of a hand at joking.');
lines.push('Bill had helped him to sausages, played tennis with him, borrowed his');
lines.push('tobacco, lent him a putter.... and here was Antony saying that he was');
lines.push('what? Well, not an ordinary man, anyway. A man with a secret. Perhaps');
lines.push('a murderer. No, not a murderer; not Cayley. That was rot, anyway. Why,');
lines.push('they had played tennis together.');
lines.push('"Now then, Watson," said Antony suddenly. "It\'s time you said');
lines.push('something."');
lines.push('"I say, Tony, do you really mean it?"');
lines.push('"Mean what?"');
lines.push('"About Cayley."');
lines.push('"I mean what I said, Bill. No more."');
lines.push('"Well, what does it amount to?"');
lines.push('"Simply that Robert Ablett died in the office this afternoon, and that');
lines.push('Cayley knows exactly how he died. That\'s all. It doesn\'t follow that');
lines.push('Cayley killed him."');
lines.push('"No. No, of course it doesn\'t." Bill gave a sigh of relief. "He\'s just');
lines.push('shielding Mark, what?"');
lines.push('"I wonder."');
lines.push('"Well, isn\'t that the simplest explanation?"');
lines.push('"It\'s the simplest if you\'re a friend of Cayley and want to let him down');
lines.push('lightly. But then I\'m not, you see."');
lines.push('"Why isn\'t it simple, anyhow?"');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s have the explanation then, and I\'ll undertake to give you');
lines.push('a simpler one afterwards. Go on. Only remember the key is on the outside');
lines.push('of the door to start with."');
lines.push('"Yes; well, I don\'t mind that. Mark goes in to see his brother, and they');
lines.push('quarrel and all the rest of it, just as Cayley was saying. Cayley hears');
lines.push('the shot, and in order to give Mark time to get away, locks the door,');
lines.push('puts the key in his pocket and pretends that Mark has locked the door,');
lines.push('and that he can\'t get in. How\'s that?"');
lines.push('"Hopeless, Watson, hopeless."');
lines.push('"Why?"');
lines.push('"How does Cayley know that it is Mark who has shot Robert, and not the');
lines.push('other way round?"');
lines.push('"Oh!" said Bill, rather upset. "Yes." He thought for a moment, "All');
lines.push('right. Say that Cayley has gone into the room first, and seen Robert on');
lines.push('the ground."');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"Well, there you are."');
lines.push('"And what does he say to Mark? That it\'s a fine afternoon; and could he');
lines.push('lend him a pocket-handkerchief? Or does he ask him what\'s happened?"');
lines.push('"Well, of course, I suppose he asks what happened," said Bill');
lines.push('reluctantly.');
lines.push('"And what does Mark say?"');
lines.push('"Explains that the revolver went off accidentally during a struggle."');
lines.push('"Whereupon Cayley shields him by doing what, Bill? Encouraging him to do');
lines.push('the damn silliest thing that any man could possibly do--confess his guilt');
lines.push('by running away!"');
lines.push('"No, that\'s rather hopeless, isn\'t it?" Bill thought again. "Well,"');
lines.push('he said reluctantly, "suppose Mark confessed that he\'d murdered his');
lines.push('brother?"');
lines.push('"That\'s better, Bill. Don\'t be afraid of getting away from the accident');
lines.push('idea. Well then, your new theory is this. Mark confesses to Cayley');
lines.push('that he shot Robert on purpose, and Cayley decides, even at the risk of');
lines.push('committing perjury, and getting into trouble himself, to help Mark to');
lines.push('escape. Is that right?"');
lines.push('Bill nodded.');
lines.push('"Well then, I want to ask you two questions. First, is it possible, as I');
lines.push('said before dinner, that any man would commit such an idiotic murder--a');
lines.push('murder that puts the rope so very tightly round his neck? Secondly, if');
lines.push('Cayley is prepared to perjure himself for Mark (as he has to, anyway,');
lines.push('now), wouldn\'t it be simpler for him to say that he was in the office');
lines.push('all the time, and that Robert\'s death was accidental?"');
lines.push('Bill considered this carefully, and then nodded slowly again.');
lines.push('"Yes, my simple explanation is a wash-out," he said. "Now let\'s have');
lines.push('yours."');
lines.push('Antony did not answer him. He had begun to think about something quite');
lines.push('different.');
lines.push('CHAPTER IX. Possibilities of a Croquet Set');
lines.push('"What\'s the matter?" said Bill sharply.');
lines.push('Antony looked round at him with raised eyebrows.');
lines.push('"You\'ve thought of something suddenly," said Bill. "What is it?"');
lines.push('Antony laughed.');
lines.push('"My dear Watson," he said, "you aren\'t supposed to be as clever as');
lines.push('this."');
lines.push('"Oh, you can\'t take me in!"');
lines.push('"No.... Well, I was wondering about this ghost of yours, Bill. It seems');
lines.push('to me--"');
lines.push('"Oh, that!" Bill was profoundly disappointed. "What on earth has the');
lines.push('ghost got to do with it?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t know," said Antony apologetically. "I don\'t know what anything');
lines.push('has got to do with it. I was just wondering. You shouldn\'t have brought');
lines.push('me here if you hadn\'t wanted me to think about the ghost. This is where');
lines.push('she appeared, isn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"Yes." Bill was distinctly short about it.');
lines.push('"How?"');
lines.push('"What?"');
lines.push('"I said, \'How?\'"');
lines.push('"How? How do ghosts appear? I don\'t know. They just appear."');
lines.push('"Over four or five hundred yards of open park?"');
lines.push('"Well, but she had to appear here, because this is where the original');
lines.push('one--Lady Anne, you know--was supposed to walk."');
lines.push('"Oh, never mind Lady Anne! A real ghost can do anything. But how did');
lines.push('Miss Norris appear suddenly over five hundred yards of bare park?"');
lines.push('Bill looked at Antony with open mouth.');
lines.push('"I--I don\'t know," he stammered. "We never thought of that."');
lines.push('"You would have seen her long before, wouldn\'t you, if she had come the');
lines.push('way we came?"');
lines.push('"Of course we should."');
lines.push('"And that would have spoilt it rather. You would have had time to');
lines.push('recognize her walk."');
lines.push('Bill was interested now.');
lines.push('"That\'s rather funny, you know, Tony. We none of us thought of that."');
lines.push('"You\'re sure she didn\'t come across the park when none of you were');
lines.push('looking?"');
lines.push('"Quite. Because, you see, Betty and I were expecting her, and we kept');
lines.push('looking round in case we saw her, so that we should all be playing with');
lines.push('our backs to her."');
lines.push('"You and Miss Calladine were playing together?"');
lines.push('"I say, however do you know that?"');
lines.push('"Brilliant deductive reasoning. Well, then you suddenly saw her?"');
lines.push('"Yes, she walked across that side of the lawn." He indicated the');
lines.push('opposite side, nearer to the house.');
lines.push('"She couldn\'t have been hiding in the ditch? Do you call it the moat, by');
lines.push('the way?"');
lines.push('"Mark does. We don\'t among ourselves. No, she couldn\'t. Betty and I');
lines.push('were here before the others, and walked round a bit. We should have seen');
lines.push('her."');
lines.push('"Then she must have been hiding in the shed. Or do you call it the');
lines.push('summer-house?"');
lines.push('"We had to go there for the bowls, of course. She couldn\'t have been');
lines.push('there."');
lines.push('"Oh!"');
lines.push('"It\'s dashed funny," said Bill, after an interval for thought. "But it');
lines.push('doesn\'t matter, does it? It has nothing to do with Robert."');
lines.push('"Hasn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"I say, has it?" said Bill, getting excited again.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know. We don\'t know what has, or what hasn\'t. But it has');
lines.push('got something to do with Miss Norris. And Miss Norris--" He broke off');
lines.push('suddenly.');
lines.push('"What about her?"');
lines.push('"Well, you\'re all in it in a kind of way. And if something unaccountable');
lines.push('happens to one of you a day or two before something unaccountable');
lines.push('happens to the whole house, one is well, interested." It was a good');
lines.push('enough reason, but it wasn\'t the reason he had been on the point of');
lines.push('giving.');
lines.push('"I see. Well?"');
lines.push('Antony knocked out his pipe and got up slowly.');
lines.push('"Well then, let\'s find the way from the house by which Miss Norris');
lines.push('came."');
lines.push('Bill jumped up eagerly.');
lines.push('"By Jove! Do you mean there\'s a secret passage?"');
lines.push('"A secluded passage, anyway. There must be."');
lines.push('"I say, what fun! I love secret passages. Good Lord, and this afternoon');
lines.push('I was playing golf just like an ordinary merchant! What a life! Secret');
lines.push('passages!"');
lines.push('They made their way down into the ditch. If an opening was to be found');
lines.push('which led to the house, it would probably be on the house side of the');
lines.push('green, and on the outside of the ditch. The most obvious place at which');
lines.push('to begin the search was the shed where the bowls were kept. It was a');
lines.push('tidy place as anything in Mark\'s establishment would be. There were two');
lines.push('boxes of croquet things, one of them with the lid open, as if the');
lines.push('balls and mallets and, hoops (neatly enough put away, though) had been');
lines.push('recently used; a box of bowls, a small lawn-mower, a roller and so');
lines.push('forth. A seat ran along the back of it, whereon the bowls-players could');
lines.push('sit when it rained.');
lines.push('Antony tapped the wall at the back.');
lines.push('"This is where the passage ought to begin. It doesn\'t sound very hollow,');
lines.push('does it?"');
lines.push('"It needn\'t begin here at all, need it?" said Bill, walking round with');
lines.push('bent head, and tapping the other walls. He was just too tall to stand');
lines.push('upright in the shed.');
lines.push('"There\'s only one reason why it should, and that is that it would save');
lines.push('us the trouble of looking anywhere else for it. Surely Mark didn\'t');
lines.push('let you play croquet on his bowling-green?" He pointed to the croquet');
lines.push('things.');
lines.push('"He didn\'t encourage it at one time, but this year he got rather keen');
lines.push('about it. There\'s really nowhere else to play. Personally I hate the');
lines.push('game. He wasn\'t very keen on bowls, you know, but he liked calling it');
lines.push('the bowling-green, and surprising his visitors with it."');
lines.push('Antony laughed.');
lines.push('"I love you on Mark," he said. "You\'re priceless."');
lines.push('He began to feel in his pockets for his pipe and tobacco, and then');
lines.push('suddenly stopped and stiffened to attention. For a moment he stood');
lines.push('listening, with his head on one side, holding up a finger to bid Bill');
lines.push('listen too.');
lines.push('"What is it?" whispered Bill.');
lines.push('Antony waved him to silence, and remained listening. Very quietly he');
lines.push('went down on his knees, and listened again. Then he put his ear to the');
lines.push('floor. He got up and dusted himself quickly, walked across to Bill and');
lines.push('whispered in his ear:');
lines.push('"Footsteps. Somebody coming. When I begin to talk, back me up."');
lines.push('Bill nodded. Antony gave him an encouraging pat on the back, and stepped');
lines.push('firmly across to the box of bowls, whistling loudly to himself. He took');
lines.push('the bowls out, dropped one with a loud bang on the floor, said, "Oh,');
lines.push('Lord!" and went on:');
lines.push('"I say, Bill, I don\'t think I want to play bowls, after all."');
lines.push('"Well, why did you say you did?" grumbled Bill.');
lines.push('Antony flashed a smile of appreciation at him.');
lines.push('"Well, I wanted to when I said I did, and now I don\'t want to."');
lines.push('"Then what do you want to do?"');
lines.push('"Talk."');
lines.push('"Oh, right-o!" said Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('"There\'s a seat on the lawn--I saw it. Let\'s bring these things along in');
lines.push('case we want to play, after all."');
lines.push('"Right-o!" said Bill again. He felt safe with that, not wishing to');
lines.push('commit himself until he knew what he was wanted to say.');
lines.push('As they went across the lawn, Antony dropped the bowls and took out his');
lines.push('pipe.');
lines.push('"Got a match?" he said loudly.');
lines.push('As he bent his head over the match, he whispered, "There\'ll be somebody');
lines.push('listening to us. You take the Cayley view," and then went on in his');
lines.push('ordinary voice, "I don\'t think much of your matches, Bill," and struck');
lines.push('another. They walked over to the seat and sat down.');
lines.push('"What a heavenly night!" said Antony.');
lines.push('"Ripping."');
lines.push('"I wonder where that poor devil Mark is now."');
lines.push('"It\'s a rum business."');
lines.push('"You agree with Cayley that it was an accident?"');
lines.push('"Yes. You see, I know Mark."');
lines.push('"H\'m." Antony produced a pencil and a piece of paper and began to write');
lines.push('on his knee, but while he wrote, he talked. He said that he thought Mark');
lines.push('had shot his brother in a fit of anger, and that Cayley knew, or anyhow');
lines.push('guessed, this and had tried to give his cousin a chance of getting away.');
lines.push('"Mind you, I think he\'s right. I think it\'s what any of us would do. I');
lines.push('shan\'t give it away, of course, but somehow there are one or two little');
lines.push('things which make me think that Mark really did shoot his brother I mean');
lines.push('other than accidentally."');
lines.push('"Murdered him?"');
lines.push('"Well, manslaughtered him, anyway. I may be wrong. Anyway, it\'s not my');
lines.push('business."');
lines.push('"But why do you think so? Because of the keys?"');
lines.push('"Oh, the keys are a wash-out. Still, it was a brilliant idea of mine,');
lines.push('Wasn\'t it? And it would have been rather a score for me if they had all');
lines.push('been outside."');
lines.push('He had finished his writing, and now passed the paper over to Bill. In');
lines.push('the clear moonlight the carefully printed letters could easily be read:');
lines.push('"GO ON TALKING AS IF I WERE HERE. AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO, TURN ROUND AS');
lines.push('IF I WERE SITTING ON THE GRASS BEHIND YOU, BUT GO ON TALKING."');
lines.push('"I know you don\'t agree with me," Antony went on as Bill read, "but');
lines.push('you\'ll see that I\'m right."');
lines.push('Bill looked up and nodded eagerly. He had forgotten golf and Betty and');
lines.push('all the other things which had made up his world lately. This was the');
lines.push('real thing. This was life. "Well," he began deliberately, "the whole');
lines.push('point is that I know Mark. Now, Mark--"');
lines.push('But Antony was off the seat and letting himself gently down into the');
lines.push('ditch. His intention was to crawl round it until the shed came in sight.');
lines.push('The footsteps which he had heard seemed to be underneath the shed;');
lines.push('probably there was a trap-door of some kind in the floor. Whoever it was');
lines.push('would have heard their voices, and would probably think it worth while');
lines.push('to listen to what they were saying. He might do this merely by opening');
lines.push('the door a little without showing himself, in which case Antony would');
lines.push('have found the entrance to the passage without any trouble to himself.');
lines.push('But when Bill turned his head and talked over the back of the seat, it');
lines.push('was probable that the listener would find it necessary to put his head');
lines.push('outside in order to hear, and then Antony would be able to discover');
lines.push('who it was. Moreover, if he should venture out of his hiding-place');
lines.push('altogether and peep at them over the top of the bank, the fact that Bill');
lines.push('was talking over the back of the seat would mislead the watcher into');
lines.push('thinking that Antony was still there, sitting on the grass, no doubt,');
lines.push('behind the seat, swinging his legs over the side of the ditch.');
lines.push('He walked quickly but very silently along the half-length of the');
lines.push('bowling-green to the first corner, passed cautiously round, and then');
lines.push('went even more carefully along the width of it to the second corner.');
lines.push('He could hear Bill hard at it, arguing from his knowledge of Mark\'s');
lines.push('character that this, that and the other must have happened, and he');
lines.push('smiled appreciatively to himself. Bill was a great conspirator worth a');
lines.push('hundred Watsons. As he approached the second corner he slowed down, and');
lines.push('did the last few yards on hands and knees. Then, lying at full length,');
lines.push('inch by inch his head went round the corner.');
lines.push('The shed was two or three yards to his left, on the opposite side of');
lines.push('the ditch. From where he lay he could see almost entirely inside it.');
lines.push('Everything seemed to be as they left it. The bowls-box, the lawn-mower,');
lines.push('the roller, the open croquet-box, the--');
lines.push('"By Jove!" said Antony to himself, "that\'s neat."');
lines.push('The lid of the other croquet-box was open, too. Bill was turning round');
lines.push('now; his voice became more difficult to hear. "You see what I mean," he');
lines.push('was saying. "If Cayley--"');
lines.push('And out of the second croquet-box came Cayley\'s black head.');
lines.push('Antony wanted to shout his applause. It was neat, devilish neat. For a');
lines.push('moment he gazed, fascinated, at that wonderful new kind of croquet-ball');
lines.push('which had appeared so dramatically out of the box, and then reluctantly');
lines.push('wriggled himself back. There was nothing to be gained by staying there,');
lines.push('and a good deal to be lost, for Bill showed signs of running down. As');
lines.push('quickly as he could Antony hurried round the ditch and took up his place');
lines.push('at the back of the seat. Then he stood up with a yawn, stretched himself');
lines.push('and said carelessly, "Well, don\'t worry yourself about it, Bill, old');
lines.push('man. I daresay you\'re right. You know Mark, and I don\'t; and that\'s the');
lines.push('difference. Shall we have a game or shall we go to bed?"');
lines.push('Bill looked at him for inspiration, and, receiving it, said, "Oh, just');
lines.push('let\'s have one game, shall we?"');
lines.push('"Right you are," said Antony.');
lines.push('But Bill was much too excited to take the game which followed very');
lines.push('seriously. Antony, on the other hand, seemed to be thinking of nothing');
lines.push('but bowls. He played with great deliberation for ten minutes, and then');
lines.push('announced that he was going to bed. Bill looked at him anxiously.');
lines.push('"It\'s all right," laughed Antony. "You can talk if you want to. Just');
lines.push('let\'s put \'em away first, though."');
lines.push('They made their way down to the shed, and while Bill was putting the');
lines.push('bowls away, Antony tried the lid of the closed croquet-box. As he');
lines.push('expected, it was locked.');
lines.push('"Now then," said Bill, as they were walking back to the house again,');
lines.push('"I\'m simply bursting to know. Who was it?"');
lines.push('"Cayley."');
lines.push('"Good Lord! Where?"');
lines.push('"Inside one of the croquet-boxes."');
lines.push('"Don\'t be an ass."');
lines.push('"It\'s quite true, Bill." He told the other what he had seen.');
lines.push('"But aren\'t we going to have a look at it?" asked Bill, in great');
lines.push('disappointment. "I\'m longing to explore. Aren\'t you?"');
lines.push('"To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow. We shall see Cayley coming along');
lines.push('this way directly. Besides, I want to get in from the other end, if I');
lines.push('can. I doubt very much if we can do it this end without giving ourselves');
lines.push('away. Look, there\'s Cayley."');
lines.push('They could see him coming along the drive towards them. When they were a');
lines.push('little closer, they waved to him and he waved back.');
lines.push('"I wondered where you were," he said, as he got up to them. "I rather');
lines.push('thought you might be along this way. What about bed?"');
lines.push('"Bed it is," said Antony.');
lines.push('"We\'ve been playing bowls," added Bill, "and talking, and--and playing');
lines.push('bowls. Ripping night, isn\'t it?"');
lines.push('But he left the rest of the conversation, as they wandered back to the');
lines.push('house, to Antony. He wanted to think. There seemed to be no doubt now');
lines.push('that Cayley was a villain. Bill had never been familiar with a villain');
lines.push('before. It didn\'t seem quite fair of Cayley, somehow; he was taking');
lines.push('rather a mean advantage of his friends. Lot of funny people there were');
lines.push('in the world funny people with secrets. Look at Tony, that first time he');
lines.push('had met him in a tobacconist\'s shop. Anybody would have thought he was');
lines.push('a tobacconist\'s assistant. And Cayley. Anybody would have thought that');
lines.push('Cayley was an ordinary decent sort of person. And Mark. Dash it! one');
lines.push('could never be sure of anybody. Now, Robert was different. Everybody had');
lines.push('always said that Robert was a shady fellow.');
lines.push('But what on earth had Miss Norris got to do with it? What had Miss');
lines.push('Norris got to do with it? This was a question which Antony had already');
lines.push('asked himself that afternoon, and it seemed to him now that he had found');
lines.push('the answer. As he lay in bed that night he reassembled his ideas, and');
lines.push('looked at them in the new light which the events of the evening threw');
lines.push('upon the dark corners in his brain.');
lines.push('Of course it was natural that Cayley should want to get rid of his');
lines.push('guests as soon as the tragedy was discovered. He would want this for');
lines.push('their own sake as well as for his. But he had been a little too quick');
lines.push('about suggesting it, and about seeing the suggestion carried out. They');
lines.push('had been bustled off as soon as they could be packed. The suggestion');
lines.push('that they were in his hands, to go or stay as he wished, could have been');
lines.push('left safely to them. As it was, they had been given no alternative,');
lines.push('and Miss Norris, who had proposed to catch an after-dinner train at the');
lines.push('junction, in the obvious hope that she might have in this way a');
lines.push('dramatic cross-examination at the hands of some keen-eyed detective, was');
lines.push('encouraged tactfully, but quite firmly, to travel by the earlier train');
lines.push('with the others. Antony had felt that Cayley, in the tragedy which had');
lines.push('suddenly befallen the house, ought to have been equally indifferent to');
lines.push('her presence or absence. But he was not; and Antony assumed from this');
lines.push('that Cayley was very much alive to the necessity for her absence.');
lines.push('Why?');
lines.push('Well, that question was not to be answered off-hand. But the fact that');
lines.push('it was so had made Antony interested in her; and it was for this reason');
lines.push('that he had followed up so alertly Bill\'s casual mention of her in');
lines.push('connection with the dressing-up business. He felt that he wanted to know');
lines.push('a little more about Miss Norris and the part she had played in the Red');
lines.push('House circle. By sheer luck, as it seemed to him, he had stumbled on the');
lines.push('answer to his question.');
lines.push('Miss Norris was hurried away because she knew about the secret passage.');
lines.push('The passage, then, had something to do with the mystery of Robert\'s');
lines.push('death. Miss Norris had used it in order to bring off her dramatic');
lines.push('appearance as the ghost. Possibly she had discovered it for herself;');
lines.push('possibly Mark had revealed it to her secretly one day, never guessing');
lines.push('that she would make so unkind a use of it later on; possibly Cayley,');
lines.push('having been let into the joke of the dressing-up, had shown her how she');
lines.push('could make her appearance on the bowling-green even more mysterious and');
lines.push('supernatural. One way or another, she knew about the secret passage. So');
lines.push('she must be hurried away.');
lines.push('Why? Because if she stayed and talked, she might make some innocent');
lines.push('mention of it. And Cayley did not want any mention of it.');
lines.push('Why, again? Obviously because the passage, or even the mere knowledge of');
lines.push('its existence, might provide a clue.');
lines.push('"I wonder if Mark\'s hiding there," thought Antony; and he went to sleep.');
lines.push('CHAPTER X. Mr. Gillingham Talks Nonsense');
lines.push('Antony came down in a very good humour to breakfast next morning, and');
lines.push('found that his host was before him. Cayley looked up from his letters');
lines.push('and nodded.');
lines.push('"Any word of Mr. Ablett--of Mark?" said Antony, as he poured out his');
lines.push('coffee.');
lines.push('"No. The inspector wants to drag the lake this afternoon."');
lines.push('"Oh! Is there a lake?"');
lines.push('There was just the flicker of a smile on Cayley\'s face, but it');
lines.push('disappeared as quickly as it came.');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s really a pond," he said, "but it was called \'the lake.\'"');
lines.push('"By Mark," thought Antony. Aloud he said, "What do they expect to find?"');
lines.push('"They think that Mark--" He broke off and shrugged his shoulders.');
lines.push('"May have drowned himself, knowing that he couldn\'t get away? And');
lines.push('knowing that he had compromised himself by trying to get away at all?"');
lines.push('"Yes; I suppose so," said Cayley slowly.');
lines.push('"I should have thought he would have given himself more of a run for');
lines.push('his money. After all, he had a revolver. If he was determined not to');
lines.push('be taken alive, he could always have prevented that. Couldn\'t he have');
lines.push('caught a train to London before the police knew anything about it?"');
lines.push('"He might just have managed it. There was a train. They would have');
lines.push('noticed him at Waldheim, of course, but he might have managed it at');
lines.push('Stanton. He\'s not so well-known there, naturally. The inspector has been');
lines.push('inquiring. Nobody seems to have seen him."');
lines.push('"There are sure to be people who will say they did, later on. There was');
lines.push('never a missing man yet but a dozen people come forward who swear to');
lines.push('have seen him at a dozen different places at the same time."');
lines.push('Cayley smiled.');
lines.push('"Yes. That\'s true. Anyhow, he wants to drag the pond first." He added');
lines.push('dryly, "From what I\'ve read of detective stories, inspectors always do');
lines.push('want to drag the pond first."');
lines.push('"Is it deep?"');
lines.push('"Quite deep enough," said Cayley as he got up. On his way to the door he');
lines.push('stopped, and looked at Antony. "I\'m so sorry that we\'re keeping you here');
lines.push('like this, but it will only be until to-morrow. The inquest is to-morrow');
lines.push('afternoon. Do amuse yourself how you like till then. Beverley will look');
lines.push('after you."');
lines.push('"Thanks very much. I shall really be quite all right."');
lines.push('Antony went on with his breakfast. Perhaps it was true that inspectors');
lines.push('liked dragging ponds, but the question was, did Cayleys like having them');
lines.push('dragged? Was Cayley anxious about it, or quite indifferent? He certainly');
lines.push('did not seem to be anxious, but he could hide his feelings very easily');
lines.push('beneath that heavy, solid face, and it was not often that the real');
lines.push('Cayley peeped out. Just a little too eager once or twice, perhaps, but');
lines.push('there was nothing to be learnt from it this morning. Perhaps he knew');
lines.push('that the pond had no secrets to give up. After all, inspectors were');
lines.push('always dragging ponds.');
lines.push('Bill came in noisily.');
lines.push('Bill\'s face was an open book. Excitement was written all over it.');
lines.push('"Well," he said eagerly, as he sat down to the business of the meal,');
lines.push('"what are we going to do this morning?"');
lines.push('"Not talk so loudly, for one thing," said Antony. Bill looked about');
lines.push('him apprehensively. Was Cayley under the table, for example? After last');
lines.push('night one never knew.');
lines.push('"Is er--" He raised his eyebrows.');
lines.push('"No. But one doesn\'t want to shout. One should modulate the voice, my');
lines.push('dear William, while breathing gently from the hips. Thus one avoids');
lines.push('those chest-notes which have betrayed many a secret. In other words,');
lines.push('pass the toast."');
lines.push('"You seem bright this morning."');
lines.push('"I am. Very bright. Cayley noticed it. Cayley said, \'Were it not that I');
lines.push('have other business, I would come gathering nuts and may with thee. Fain');
lines.push('would I gyrate round the mulberry-bush and hop upon the little hills.');
lines.push('But the waters of Jordan encompass me and Inspector Birch tarries');
lines.push('outside with his shrimping-net. My friend William Beverley will attend');
lines.push('thee anon. Farewell, a long farewell to all--thy grape-nuts.\' He then');
lines.push('left up-centre. Enter W. Beverley, R."');
lines.push('"Are you often like this at breakfast?"');
lines.push('"Almost invariably. Said he with his mouth full. \'Exit W. Beverley, L."');
lines.push('"It\'s a touch of the sun, I suppose," said Bill, shaking his head sadly.');
lines.push('"It\'s the sun and the moon and the stars, all acting together on an');
lines.push('empty stomach. Do you know anything about the stars, Mr. Beverley? Do');
lines.push('you know anything about Orion\'s Belt, for instance? And why isn\'t there');
lines.push('a star called Beverley\'s Belt? Or a novel? Said he masticating. Re-enter');
lines.push('W. Beverley through trap-door."');
lines.push('"Talking about trap-doors--"');
lines.push('"Don\'t," said Antony, getting up. "Some talk of Alexander and some of');
lines.push('Hercules, but nobody talks about--what\'s the Latin for trap-door?--Mensa');
lines.push('a table; you might get it from that. Well, Mr. Beverley,"--and he');
lines.push('slapped him heartily on the back as he went past him--"I shall see you');
lines.push('later. Cayley says that you will amuse me, but so far you have not made');
lines.push('me laugh once. You must try and be more amusing when you have finished');
lines.push('your breakfast. But don\'t hurry. Let the upper mandibles have time to');
lines.push('do the work." With those words Mr. Gillingham then left the spacious');
lines.push('apartment.');
lines.push('Bill continued his breakfast with a slightly bewildered air. He did not');
lines.push('know that Cayley was smoking a cigarette outside the windows behind him;');
lines.push('not listening, perhaps; possibly not even overhearing; but within sight');
lines.push('of Antony, who was not going to take any risks. So he went on with his');
lines.push('breakfast, reflecting that Antony was a rum fellow, and wondering if');
lines.push('he had dreamed only of the amazing things which had happened the day');
lines.push('before.');
lines.push('Antony went up to his bedroom to fetch his pipe. It was occupied by');
lines.push('a housemaid, and he made a polite apology for disturbing her. Then he');
lines.push('remembered.');
lines.push('"Is it Elsie?" he asked, giving her a friendly smile.');
lines.push('"Yes, sir," she said, shy but proud. She had no doubts as to why it was');
lines.push('that she had achieved such notoriety.');
lines.push('"It was you who heard Mr. Mark yesterday, wasn\'t it? I hope the');
lines.push('inspector was nice to you?"');
lines.push('"Yes, thank you, sir."');
lines.push('"\'It\'s my turn now. You wait,\'" murmured Antony to himself.');
lines.push('"Yes, sir. Nasty-like. Meaning to say his chance had come."');
lines.push('"I wonder."');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s what I heard, sir. Truly."');
lines.push('Antony looked at her thoughtfully and nodded.');
lines.push('"Yes. I wonder. I wonder why."');
lines.push('"Why what, sir?"');
lines.push('"Oh, lots of things, Elsie.... It was quite an accident your being');
lines.push('outside just then?"');
lines.push('Elsie blushed. She had not forgotten what Mrs. Stevens had said about');
lines.push('it.');
lines.push('"Quite, sir. In the general way I use the other stairs."');
lines.push('"Of course."');
lines.push('He had found his pipe and was about to go downstairs again when she');
lines.push('stopped him.');
lines.push('"I beg your pardon, sir, but will there be an inquest?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes. To-morrow, I think."');
lines.push('"Shall I have to give my evidence, sir?"');
lines.push('"Of course. There\'s nothing to be frightened of."');
lines.push('"I did hear it, sir. Truly."');
lines.push('"Why, of course you did. Who says you didn\'t?"');
lines.push('"Some of the others, sir, Mrs. Stevens and all."');
lines.push('"Oh, that\'s just because they\'re jealous," said Antony with a smile.');
lines.push('He was glad to have spoken to her, because he had recognized at once');
lines.push('the immense importance of her evidence. To the Inspector no doubt it');
lines.push('had seemed only of importance in that it had shown Mark to have adopted');
lines.push('something of a threatening attitude towards his brother. To Antony it');
lines.push('had much more significance. It was the only trustworthy evidence that');
lines.push('Mark had been in the office at all that afternoon.');
lines.push('For who saw Mark go into the office? Only Cayley. And if Cayley had been');
lines.push('hiding the truth about the keys, why should he not be hiding the truth');
lines.push('about Mark\'s entry into the office? Obviously all Cayley\'s evidence went');
lines.push('for nothing. Some of it no doubt was true; but he was giving it, both');
lines.push('truth and falsehood, with a purpose. What the purpose was Antony did not');
lines.push('know as yet; to shield Mark, to shield himself, even to betray Mark');
lines.push('it might be any of these. But since his evidence was given for his own');
lines.push('ends, it was impossible that it could be treated as the evidence of');
lines.push('an impartial and trustworthy onlooker. Such, for instance, as Elsie');
lines.push('appeared to be.');
lines.push('Elsie\'s evidence, however, seemed to settle the point. Mark had gone');
lines.push('into the office to see his brother; Elsie had heard them both talking;');
lines.push('and then Antony and Cayley had found the body of Robert.... and the');
lines.push('Inspector was going to drag the pond.');
lines.push('But certainly Elsie\'s evidence did not prove anything more than the mere');
lines.push('presence of Mark in the room. "It\'s my turn now; you wait." That was not');
lines.push('an immediate threat;--it was a threat for the future. If Mark had shot');
lines.push('his brother immediately afterwards it must have been an accident, the');
lines.push('result of a struggle, say, provoked by that "nasty-like" tone of voice.');
lines.push('Nobody would say "You wait" to a man who was just going to be shot. "You');
lines.push('wait" meant "You wait, and see what\'s going to happen to you later on."');
lines.push('The owner of the Red House had had enough of his brother\'s sponging,');
lines.push('his brother\'s blackmail; now it was Mark\'s turn to get a bit of his own');
lines.push('back. Let Robert just wait a bit, and he would see. The conversation');
lines.push('which Elsie had overheard might have meant something like this. It');
lines.push('couldn\'t have meant murder. Anyway not murder of Robert by Mark.');
lines.push('"It\'s a funny business," thought Antony. "The one obvious solution is so');
lines.push('easy and yet so wrong. And I\'ve got a hundred things in my head, and I');
lines.push('can\'t fit them together. And this afternoon will make a hundred and one.');
lines.push('I mustn\'t forget this afternoon."');
lines.push('He found Bill in the hall and proposed a stroll. Bill was only too');
lines.push('ready. "Where do you want to go?" he asked.');
lines.push('"I don\'t mind much. Show me the park."');
lines.push('"Righto."');
lines.push('They walked out together.');
lines.push('"Watson, old man," said Antony, as soon as they were away from the');
lines.push('house, "you really mustn\'t talk so loudly indoors. There was a gentleman');
lines.push('outside, just behind you, all the time."');
lines.push('"Oh, I say," said Bill, going pink. "I\'m awfully sorry. So that\'s why');
lines.push('you were talking such rot."');
lines.push('"Partly, yes. And partly because I do feel rather bright this morning.');
lines.push('We\'re going to have a busy day."');
lines.push('"Are we really? What are we going to do?"');
lines.push('"They\'re going to drag the pond--beg its pardon, the lake. Where is the');
lines.push('lake?"');
lines.push('"We\'re on the way to it now, if you\'d like to see it."');
lines.push('"We may as well look at it. Do you haunt the lake much in the ordinary');
lines.push('way?"');
lines.push('"Oh, no, rather not. There\'s nothing to do there."');
lines.push('"You can\'t bathe?"');
lines.push('"Well, I shouldn\'t care to. Too dirty."');
lines.push('"I see.... This is the way we came yesterday, isn\'t it? The way to the');
lines.push('village?"');
lines.push('"Yes. We go off a bit to the right directly. What are they dragging it');
lines.push('for?"');
lines.push('"Mark."');
lines.push('"Oh, rot," said Bill uneasily. He was silent for a little, and then,');
lines.push('forgetting his uncomfortable thoughts in his sudden remembrance of the');
lines.push('exciting times they were having, said eagerly, "I say, when are we going');
lines.push('to look for that passage?"');
lines.push('"We can\'t do very much while Cayley\'s in the house."');
lines.push('"What about this afternoon when they\'re dragging the pond? He\'s sure to');
lines.push('be there."');
lines.push('Antony shook his head.');
lines.push('"There\'s something I must do this afternoon," he said. "Of course we');
lines.push('might have time for both."');
lines.push('"Has Cayley got to be out of the house for the other thing too?"');
lines.push('"Well, I think he ought to be."');
lines.push('"I say, is it anything rather exciting?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t know. It might be rather interesting. I daresay I could do it');
lines.push('at some other time, but I rather fancy it at three o\'clock, somehow.');
lines.push('I\'ve been specially keeping it back for then."');
lines.push('"I say, what fun! You do want me, don\'t you?"');
lines.push('"Of course I do. Only, Bill don\'t talk about things inside the house,');
lines.push('unless I begin. There\'s a good Watson."');
lines.push('"I won\'t. I swear I won\'t."');
lines.push('They had come to the pond--Mark\'s lake--and they walked silently round');
lines.push('it. When they had made the circle, Antony sat down on the grass, and');
lines.push('relit his pipe. Bill followed his example.');
lines.push('"Well, Mark isn\'t there," said Antony.');
lines.push('"No," said Bill. "At least, I don\'t quite see why you know he isn\'t."');
lines.push('"It isn\'t \'knowing,\' it\'s \'guessing,\'" said Antony rapidly. "It\'s much');
lines.push('easier to shoot yourself than to drown yourself, and if Mark had wanted');
lines.push('to shoot himself in the water, with some idea of not letting the body be');
lines.push('found, he\'d have put big stones in his pockets, and the only big stones');
lines.push('are near the water\'s edge, and they would have left marks, and they');
lines.push('haven\'t, and therefore he didn\'t, and oh, bother the pond; that can wait');
lines.push('till this afternoon. Bill, where does the secret passage begin?"');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s what we\'ve got to find out, isn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"Yes. You see, my idea is this."');
lines.push('He explained his reasons for thinking that the secret of the passage was');
lines.push('concerned in some way with the secret of Robert\'s death, and went on:');
lines.push('"My theory is that Mark discovered the passage about a year ago--the');
lines.push('time when he began to get keen on croquet. The passage came out into');
lines.push('the floor of the shed, and probably it was Cayley\'s idea to put a');
lines.push('croquet-box over the trap-door, so as to hide it more completely. You');
lines.push('know, when once you\'ve discovered a secret yourself, it always seems');
lines.push('as if it must be so obvious to everybody else. I can imagine that Mark');
lines.push('loved having this little secret all to himself and to Cayley, of course,');
lines.push('but Cayley wouldn\'t count and they must have had great fun fixing it up,');
lines.push('and making it more difficult for other people to find out. Well then,');
lines.push('when Miss Norris was going to dress-up, Cayley gave it away. Probably');
lines.push('he told her that she could never get down to the bowling-green without');
lines.push('being discovered, and then perhaps showed that he knew there was one way');
lines.push('in which she could do it, and she wormed the secret out of him somehow."');
lines.push('"But this was two or three days before Robert turned up."');
lines.push('"Exactly. I am not suggesting that there was anything sinister about the');
lines.push('passage in the first place. It was just a little private bit of romance');
lines.push('and adventure for Mark, three days ago. He didn\'t even know that Robert');
lines.push('was coming. But somehow the passage has been used since, in connection');
lines.push('with Robert. Perhaps Mark escaped that way; perhaps he\'s hiding there');
lines.push('now. And if so, then the only person who could give him away was Miss');
lines.push('Norris. And she of course would only do it innocently not knowing that');
lines.push('the passage had anything to do with it."');
lines.push('"So it was safer to have her out of the way?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"But, look here, Tony, why do you want to bother about this end of it?');
lines.push('We can always get in at the bowling-green end."');
lines.push('"I know, but if we do that we shall have to do it openly. It will mean');
lines.push('breaking open the box, and letting Cayley know that we\'ve done it. You');
lines.push('see, Bill, if we don\'t find anything out for ourselves in the next day');
lines.push('or two, we\'ve got to tell the police what we have found out, and then');
lines.push('they can explore the passage for themselves. But I don\'t want to do that');
lines.push('yet."');
lines.push('"Rather not.');
lines.push('"So we\'ve got to carry on secretly for a bit. It\'s the only way." He');
lines.push('smiled and added, "And it\'s much more fun."');
lines.push('"Rather!" Bill chuckled to himself.');
lines.push('"Very well. Where does the secret passage begin?"');
lines.push('CHAPTER XI. The Reverend Theodore Ussher');
lines.push('"There\'s one thing, which we have got to realize at once," said Antony,');
lines.push('"and that is that if we don\'t find it easily, we shan\'t find it at all."');
lines.push('"You mean that we shan\'t have time?"');
lines.push('"Neither time nor opportunity. Which is rather a consoling thought to a');
lines.push('lazy person like me."');
lines.push('"But it makes it much harder, if we can\'t really look properly."');
lines.push('"Harder to find, yes, but so much easier to look. For instance, the');
lines.push('passage might begin in Cayley\'s bedroom. Well, now we know that it');
lines.push('doesn\'t."');
lines.push('"We don\'t know anything of the sort," protested Bill.');
lines.push('"We--know for the purposes of our search. Obviously we can\'t go');
lines.push('tailing into Cayley\'s bedroom and tapping his wardrobes; and obviously,');
lines.push('therefore, if we are going to look for it at all, we must assume that it');
lines.push('doesn\'t begin there."');
lines.push('"Oh, I see." Bill chewed a piece of grass thoughtfully. "Anyhow, it');
lines.push('wouldn\'t begin on an upstairs floor, would it?"');
lines.push('"Probably not. Well, we\'re getting on."');
lines.push('"You can wash out the kitchen and all that part of the house," said');
lines.push('Bill, after more thought. "We can\'t go there."');
lines.push('"Right. And the cellars, if there are any."');
lines.push('"Well, that doesn\'t leave us much."');
lines.push('"No. Of course it\'s only a hundred-to-one chance that we find it, but');
lines.push('what we want to consider is which is the most likely place of the few');
lines.push('places in which we can look safely."');
lines.push('"All it amounts to," said Bill, "is the living-rooms');
lines.push('downstairs--dining-room, library, hall, billiard-room and the office');
lines.push('rooms."');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s all."');
lines.push('"Well, the office is the most likely, isn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Except for one thing."');
lines.push('"What\'s that?"');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s on the wrong side of the house. One would expect the passage');
lines.push('to start from the nearest place to which it is going. Why make it longer');
lines.push('by going under the house first?"');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s true. Well, then, you think the dining-room or the');
lines.push('library?"');
lines.push('"Yes. And the library for choice. I mean for our choice. There are');
lines.push('always servants going into dining-rooms. We shouldn\'t have much of a');
lines.push('chance of exploring properly in there. Besides, there\'s another thing to');
lines.push('remember. Mark has kept this a secret for a year. Could he have kept');
lines.push('it a secret in the dining-room? Could Miss Norris have got into the');
lines.push('dining-room and used the secret door just after dinner without being');
lines.push('seen? It would have been much too risky."');
lines.push('Bill got up eagerly.');
lines.push('"Come along," he said, "let\'s try the library. If Cayley comes in, we');
lines.push('can always pretend we\'re choosing a book."');
lines.push('Antony got up slowly, took his arm and walked back to the house with');
lines.push('him.');
lines.push('The library was worth going into, passages or no passages. Antony could');
lines.push('never resist another person\'s bookshelves. As soon as he went into the');
lines.push('room, he found himself wandering round it to see what books the owner');
lines.push('read, or (more likely) did not read, but kept for the air which they');
lines.push('lent to the house. Mark had prided himself on his library. It was a');
lines.push('mixed collection of books. Books which he had inherited both from his');
lines.push('father and from his patron; books which he had bought because he was');
lines.push('interested in them or, if not in them, in the authors to whom he wished');
lines.push('to lend his patronage; books which he had ordered in beautifully bound');
lines.push('editions, partly because they looked well on his shelves, lending a');
lines.push('noble colour to his rooms, partly because no man of culture should ever');
lines.push('be without them; old editions, new editions, expensive books, cheap');
lines.push('books, a library in which everybody, whatever his taste, could be sure');
lines.push('of finding something to suit him.');
lines.push('"And which is your particular fancy, Bill?" said Antony, looking from');
lines.push('one shelf to another. "Or are you always playing billiards?"');
lines.push('"I have a look at \'Badminton\' sometimes," said Bill.');
lines.push('"It\'s over in that corner there." He waved a hand.');
lines.push('"Over here?" said Antony, going to it.');
lines.push('"Yes." He corrected himself suddenly.--"Oh, no, it\'s not. It\'s over');
lines.push('there on the right now. Mark had a grand re-arrangement of his library');
lines.push('about a year ago. It took him more than a week, he told us. He\'s got');
lines.push('such a frightful lot, hasn\'t he?"');
lines.push('"Now that\'s very interesting," said Antony, and he sat down and filled');
lines.push('his pipe again.');
lines.push('There was indeed a "frightful lot" of books. The four walls of the');
lines.push('library were plastered with them from floor to ceiling, save only where');
lines.push('the door and the two windows insisted on living their own life, even');
lines.push('though an illiterate one. To Bill it seemed the most hopeless room of');
lines.push('any in which to look for a secret opening.');
lines.push('"We shall have to take every blessed book down," he said, "before we can');
lines.push('be certain that we haven\'t missed it."');
lines.push('"Anyway," said Antony, "if we take them down one at a time, nobody');
lines.push('can suspect us of sinister designs. After all, what does one go into a');
lines.push('library for, except to take books down?"');
lines.push('"But there\'s such a frightful lot."');
lines.push('Antony\'s pipe was now going satisfactorily, and he got up and walked');
lines.push('leisurely to the end of the wall opposite the door.');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s have a look," he said, "and see if they are so very');
lines.push('frightful. Hallo, here\'s your \'Badminton.\' You often read that, you');
lines.push('say?"');
lines.push('"If I read anything."');
lines.push('"Yes." He looked down and up the shelf. "Sport and Travel chiefly. I');
lines.push('like books of travel, don\'t you?"');
lines.push('"They\'re pretty dull as a rule."');
lines.push('"Well, anyhow, some people like them very much," said Antony,');
lines.push('reproachfully. He moved on to the next row of shelves. "The Drama. The');
lines.push('Restoration dramatists. You can have most of them. Still, as you well');
lines.push('remark, many people seem to love them. Shaw, Wilde, Robertson--I like');
lines.push('reading plays, Bill. There are not many people who do, but those who do');
lines.push('are usually very keen. Let us pass on."');
lines.push('"I say, we haven\'t too much time," said Bill restlessly.');
lines.push('"We haven\'t. That\'s why we aren\'t wasting any. Poetry. Who reads poetry');
lines.push('nowadays? Bill, when did you last read \'Paradise Lost\'?"');
lines.push('"Never."');
lines.push('"I thought not. And when did Miss Calladine last read \'The Excursion\'');
lines.push('aloud to you?"');
lines.push('"As a matter of fact, Betty--Miss Calladine--happens to be jolly keen on');
lines.push('what\'s the beggar\'s name?"');
lines.push('"Never mind his name. You have said quite enough. We pass on."');
lines.push('He moved on to the next shelf.');
lines.push('"Biography. Oh, lots of it. I love biographies. Are you a member of the');
lines.push('Johnson Club? I bet Mark is. \'Memories of Many Courts\' I\'m sure Mrs.');
lines.push('Calladine reads that. Anyway, biographies are just as interesting as');
lines.push('most novels, so why linger? We pass on." He went to the next shelf, and');
lines.push('then gave a sudden whistle. "Hallo, hallo!"');
lines.push('"What\'s the matter?" said Bill rather peevishly.');
lines.push('"Stand back there. Keep the crowd back, Bill. We are getting amongst it.');
lines.push('Sermons, as I live. Sermons. Was Mark\'s father a clergyman, or does Mark');
lines.push('take to them naturally?"');
lines.push('"His father was a parson, I believe. Oh, yes, I know he was."');
lines.push('"Ah, then these are Father\'s books. \'Half-Hours with the Infinite\' I');
lines.push('must order that from the library when I get back. \'The Lost Sheep,\'');
lines.push('\'Jones on the Trinity,\' \'The Epistles of St. Paul Explained.\' Oh, Bill,');
lines.push('we\'re amongst it. \'The Narrow Way, being Sermons by the Rev. Theodore');
lines.push('Ussher\' hal-LO!"');
lines.push('"What is the matter?"');
lines.push('"William, I am inspired. Stand by." He took down the Reverend Theodore');
lines.push('Ussher\'s classic work, looked at it with a happy smile for a moment, and');
lines.push('then gave it to Bill.');
lines.push('"Here, hold Ussher for a bit."');
lines.push('Bill took the book obediently.');
lines.push('"No, give it me back. Just go out into the hall, and see if you can hear');
lines.push('Cayley anywhere. Say \'Hallo\' loudly, if you do."');
lines.push('Bill went out quickly, listened, and came back.');
lines.push('"It\'s all right."');
lines.push('"Good." He took the book out of its shelf again. "Now then, you can hold');
lines.push('Ussher. Hold him in the left hand so. With the right or dexter hand,');
lines.push('grasp this shelf firmly so. Now, when I say \'Pull,\' pull gradually. Got');
lines.push('that?"');
lines.push('Bill nodded, his face alight with excitement.');
lines.push('"Good." Antony put his hand into the space left by the stout Ussher, and');
lines.push('fingered the back of the shelf. "Pull," he said.');
lines.push('Bill pulled.');
lines.push('"Now just go on pulling like that. I shall get it directly. Not hard,');
lines.push('you know, but just keeping up the strain."');
lines.push('His fingers went at it again busily.');
lines.push('And then suddenly the whole row of shelves, from top to bottom, swung');
lines.push('gently open towards them.');
lines.push('"Good Lord!" said Bill, letting go of the shelf in his amazement.');
lines.push('Antony pushed the shelves back, extracted Ussher from Bill\'s fingers,');
lines.push('replaced him, and then, taking Bill by the arm, led him to the sofa and');
lines.push('deposited him in it. Standing in front of him, he bowed gravely.');
lines.push('"Child\'s play, Watson," he said; "child\'s play."');
lines.push('"How on earth--"');
lines.push('Antony laughed happily and sat down on the sofa beside him.');
lines.push('"You don\'t really want it explained," he said, smacking him on the knee;');
lines.push('"you\'re just being Watsonish. It\'s very nice of you, of course, and I');
lines.push('appreciate it."');
lines.push('"No, but really, Tony."');
lines.push('"Oh, my dear Bill!" He smoked silently for a little, and then went on,');
lines.push('"It\'s what I was saying just now--a secret is a secret until you have');
lines.push('discovered it, and as soon as you have discovered it, you wonder why');
lines.push('everybody else isn\'t discovering it, and how it could ever have been a');
lines.push('secret at all. This passage has been here for years, with an opening at');
lines.push('one end into the library, and at the other end into the shed. Then Mark');
lines.push('discovered it, and immediately he felt that everybody else must discover');
lines.push('it. So he made the shed end more difficult by putting the croquet-box');
lines.push('there, and this end more difficult by--" he stopped and looked at the');
lines.push('other "by what, Bill?"');
lines.push('But Bill was being Watsonish.');
lines.push('"What?"');
lines.push('"Obviously by re-arranging his books. He happened to take out \'The Life');
lines.push('of Nelson\' or \'Three Men in a Boat,\' or whatever it was, and by the');
lines.push('merest chance discovered the secret. Naturally he felt that everybody');
lines.push('else would be taking down \'The Life of Nelson\' or \'Three Men in a');
lines.push('Boat.\' Naturally he felt that the secret would be safer if nobody ever');
lines.push('interfered with that shelf at all. When you said that the books had been');
lines.push('re-arranged a year ago just about the time the croquet-box came into');
lines.push('existence; of course, I guessed why. So I looked about for the dullest');
lines.push('books I could find, the books nobody ever read. Obviously the collection');
lines.push('of sermon-books of a mid-Victorian clergyman was the shelf we wanted."');
lines.push('"Yes, I see. But why were you so certain of the particular place?"');
lines.push('"Well, he had to mark the particular place by some book. I thought');
lines.push('that the joke of putting \'The Narrow Way\' just over the entrance to the');
lines.push('passage might appeal to him. Apparently it did."');
lines.push('Bill nodded to himself thoughtfully several times. "Yes, that\'s very');
lines.push('neat," he said. "You\'re a clever devil, Tony."');
lines.push('Tony laughed.');
lines.push('"You encourage me to think so, which is bad for me, but very');
lines.push('delightful."');
lines.push('"Well, come on, then," said Bill, and he got up, and held out a hand.');
lines.push('"Come on where?"');
lines.push('"To explore the passage, of course."');
lines.push('Antony shook his head.');
lines.push('"Why ever not?"');
lines.push('"Well, what do you expect to find there?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t know. But you seemed to think that we might find something that');
lines.push('would help."');
lines.push('"Suppose we find Mark?" said Antony quietly.');
lines.push('"I say, do you really think he\'s there?"');
lines.push('"Suppose he is?"');
lines.push('"Well, then, there we are."');
lines.push('Antony walked over to the fireplace, knocked out the ashes of his pipe,');
lines.push('and turned back to Bill. He looked at him gravely without speaking.');
lines.push('"What are you going to say to him?" he said at last.');
lines.push('"How do you mean?"');
lines.push('"Are you going to arrest him, or help him to escape?"');
lines.push('"I--I--well, of course, I--" began Bill, stammering, and then ended');
lines.push('lamely, "Well, I don\'t know."');
lines.push('"Exactly. We\'ve got to make up our minds, haven\'t we?"');
lines.push('Bill didn\'t answer. Very much disturbed in his mind, he walked');
lines.push('restlessly about the room, frowning to himself, stopping now and then');
lines.push('at the newly discovered door and looking at it as if he were trying to');
lines.push('learn what lay behind it. Which side was he on, if it came to choosing');
lines.push('sides--Mark\'s or the Law\'s?');
lines.push('"You know, you can\'t just say, \'Oh er hallo!\' to him," said Antony,');
lines.push('breaking rather appropriately into his thoughts.');
lines.push('Bill looked up at him with a start.');
lines.push('"Nor," went on Antony, "can you say, \'This is my friend Mr. Gillingham,');
lines.push('who is staying with you. We were just going to have a game of bowls.\'"');
lines.push('"Yes, it\'s dashed difficult. I don\'t know what to say. I\'ve been rather');
lines.push('forgetting about Mark." He wandered over to the window and looked out on');
lines.push('to the lawns. There was a gardener clipping the grass edges. No reason');
lines.push('why the lawn should be untidy just because the master of the house had');
lines.push('disappeared. It was going to be a hot day again. Dash it, of course he');
lines.push('had forgotten Mark. How could he think of him as an escaped murderer,');
lines.push('a fugitive from justice, when everything was going on just as it did');
lines.push('yesterday, and the sun was shining just as it did when they all drove');
lines.push('off to their golf, only twenty-four hours ago? How could he help feeling');
lines.push('that this was not real tragedy, but merely a jolly kind of detective');
lines.push('game that he and Antony were playing?');
lines.push('He turned back to his friend.');
lines.push('"All the same," he said, "you wanted to find the passage, and now you\'ve');
lines.push('found it. Aren\'t you going into it at all?"');
lines.push('Antony took his arm.');
lines.push('"Let\'s go outside again," he said. "We can\'t go into it now, anyhow.');
lines.push('It\'s too risky, with Cayley about. Bill, I feel like you--just a little');
lines.push('bit frightened. But what I\'m frightened of I don\'t quite know. Anyway,');
lines.push('you want to go on with it, don\'t you?"');
lines.push('"Yes," said Bill firmly. "We must."');
lines.push('"Then we\'ll explore the passage this afternoon, if we get the chance.');
lines.push('And if we don\'t get the chance, then we\'ll try it to-night."');
lines.push('They walked across the hall and out into the sunlight again.');
lines.push('"Do you really think we might find Mark hiding there?" asked Bill.');
lines.push('"It\'s possible," said Antony. "Either Mark or--" He pulled himself up');
lines.push('quickly. "No," he murmured to himself, "I won\'t let myself think');
lines.push('that--not yet, anyway. It\'s too horrible."');
lines.push('CHAPTER XII. A Shadow on the Wall');
lines.push('In the twenty hours or so at his disposal Inspector Birch had been busy.');
lines.push('He had telegraphed to London a complete description of Mark in the brown');
lines.push('flannel suit which he had last been seen wearing; he had made inquiries');
lines.push('at Stanton as to whether anybody answering to this description had');
lines.push('been seen leaving by the 4.20; and though the evidence which had been');
lines.push('volunteered to him had been inconclusive, it made it possible that');
lines.push('Mark had indeed caught that train, and had arrived in London before the');
lines.push('police at the other end had been ready to receive him. But the fact that');
lines.push('it was market-day at Stanton, and that the little town would be more');
lines.push('full than usual of visitors, made it less likely that either the');
lines.push('departure of Mark by the 4.20, or the arrival of Robert by the 2.10');
lines.push('earlier in the afternoon, would have been particularly noticed. As');
lines.push('Antony had said to Cayley, there would always be somebody ready to hand');
lines.push('the police a circumstantial story of the movements of any man in whom');
lines.push('the police were interested.');
lines.push('That Robert had come by the 2.10 seemed fairly certain. To find out more');
lines.push('about him in time for the inquest would be difficult. All that was known');
lines.push('about him in the village where he and Mark had lived as boys bore out');
lines.push('the evidence of Cayley. He was an unsatisfactory son, and he had been');
lines.push('hurried off to Australia; nor had he been seen since in the village.');
lines.push('Whether there were any more substantial grounds of quarrel between the');
lines.push('two brothers than that the younger one was at home and well-to-do,');
lines.push('while the elder was poor and an exile, was not known, nor, as far as the');
lines.push('inspector could see, was it likely to be known until Mark was captured.');
lines.push('The discovery of Mark was all that mattered immediately. Dragging');
lines.push('the pond might not help towards this, but it would certainly give the');
lines.push('impression in court to-morrow that Inspector Birch was handling the case');
lines.push('with zeal. And if only the revolver with which the deed was done was');
lines.push('brought to the surface, his trouble would be well repaid. "Inspector');
lines.push('Birch produces the weapon" would make an excellent headline in the local');
lines.push('paper.');
lines.push('He was feeling well-satisfied with himself, therefore, as he walked to');
lines.push('the pond, where his men were waiting for him, and quite in the mood for');
lines.push('a little pleasant talk with Mr. Gillingham and his friend, Mr. Beverley.');
lines.push('He gave them a cheerful "Good afternoon," and added with a smile,');
lines.push('"Coming to help us?"');
lines.push('"You don\'t really want us," said Antony, smiling back at him.');
lines.push('"You can come if you like."');
lines.push('Antony gave a little shudder.');
lines.push('"You can tell me afterwards what you find," he said. "By the way," he');
lines.push('added, "I hope the landlord at \'The George\' gave me a good character?"');
lines.push('The Inspector looked at him quickly.');
lines.push('"Now how on earth do you know anything about that?"');
lines.push('Antony bowed to him gravely.');
lines.push('"Because I guessed that you were a very efficient member of the Force."');
lines.push('The inspector laughed.');
lines.push('"Well, you came out all right, Mr. Gillingham. You got a clean bill. But');
lines.push('I had to make certain about you.');
lines.push('"Of course you did. Well, I wish you luck. But I don\'t think you\'ll');
lines.push('find much at the pond. It\'s rather out of the way, isn\'t it, for anybody');
lines.push('running away?"');
lines.push('"That\'s just what I told Mr. Cayley, when he called my attention to the');
lines.push('pond. However, we shan\'t do any harm by looking. It\'s the unexpected');
lines.push('that\'s the most likely in this sort of case."');
lines.push('"You\'re quite right, Inspector. Well, we mustn\'t keep you. Good');
lines.push('afternoon," and Antony smiled pleasantly at him.');
lines.push('"Good afternoon, sir."');
lines.push('"Good afternoon," said Bill.');
lines.push('Antony stood looking after the Inspector as he strode off, silent for');
lines.push('so long that Bill shook him by the arm at last, and asked him rather');
lines.push('crossly what was the matter.');
lines.push('Antony shook his head slowly from side to side.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know; really I don\'t know. It\'s too devilish what I keep');
lines.push('thinking. He can\'t be as cold-blooded as that."');
lines.push('"Who?"');
lines.push('Without answering, Antony led the way back to the garden-seat on which');
lines.push('they had been sitting. He sat there with his head in his hands.');
lines.push('"Oh, I hope they find something," he murmured. "Oh, I hope they do."');
lines.push('"In the pond?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"But what?"');
lines.push('"Anything, Bill; anything."');
lines.push('Bill was annoyed. "I say, Tony, this won\'t do. You really mustn\'t be so');
lines.push('damn mysterious. What\'s happened to you suddenly?"');
lines.push('Antony looked up at him in surprise.');
lines.push('"Didn\'t you hear what he said?"');
lines.push('"What, particularly?"');
lines.push('"That it was Cayley\'s idea to drag the pond."');
lines.push('"Oh! Oh, I say!" Bill was rather excited again. "You mean that he\'s');
lines.push('hidden something there? Some false clue which he wants the police to');
lines.push('find?"');
lines.push('"I hope so," said Antony earnestly, "but I\'m afraid--" He stopped short.');
lines.push('"Afraid of what?"');
lines.push('"Afraid that he hasn\'t hidden anything there. Afraid that--"');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"What\'s the safest place in which to hide anything very important?"');
lines.push('"Somewhere where nobody will look."');
lines.push('"There\'s a better place than that."');
lines.push('"What?"');
lines.push('"Somewhere where everybody has already looked."');
lines.push('"By Jove! You mean that as soon as the pond has been dragged, Cayley');
lines.push('will hide something there?"');
lines.push('"Yes, I\'m afraid so."');
lines.push('"But why afraid?"');
lines.push('"Because I think that it must be something very important, something');
lines.push('which couldn\'t easily be hidden anywhere else."');
lines.push('"What?" asked Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('Antony shook his head.');
lines.push('"No, I\'m not going to talk about it yet. We can wait and see what the');
lines.push('Inspector finds. He may find something--I don\'t know what--something');
lines.push('that Cayley has put there for him to find. But if he doesn\'t, then it');
lines.push('will be because Cayley is going to hide something there to-night."');
lines.push('"What?" asked Bill again.');
lines.push('"You will see what, Bill," said Antony; "because we shall be there."');
lines.push('"Are we going to watch him?"');
lines.push('"Yes, if the Inspector finds nothing."');
lines.push('"That\'s good," said Bill.');
lines.push('If it were a question of Cayley or the Law, he was quite decided as to');
lines.push('which side he was taking. Previous to the tragedy of yesterday he had');
lines.push('got on well enough with both of the cousins, without being in the least');
lines.push('intimate with either. Indeed, of the two he preferred, perhaps, the');
lines.push('silent, solid Cayley to the more volatile Mark. Cayley\'s qualities, as');
lines.push('they appeared to Bill, may have been chiefly negative; but even if this');
lines.push('merit lay in the fact that he never exposed whatever weaknesses he may');
lines.push('have had, this is an excellent quality in a fellow-guest (or, if you');
lines.push('like, fellow-host) in a house where one is continually visiting. Mark\'s');
lines.push('weaknesses, on the other hand, were very plain to the eye, and Bill had');
lines.push('seen a good deal of them.');
lines.push('Yet, though he had hesitated to define his position that morning in');
lines.push('regard to Mark, he did not hesitate to place himself on the side of the');
lines.push('Law against Cayley. Mark, after all, had done him no harm, but Cayley');
lines.push('had committed an unforgivable offence. Cayley had listened secretly to');
lines.push('a private conversation between himself and Tony. Let Cayley hang, if the');
lines.push('Law demanded it.');
lines.push('Antony looked at his watch and stood up.');
lines.push('"Come along," he said. "It\'s time for that job I spoke about."');
lines.push('"The passage?" said Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('"No; the thing which I said that I had to do this afternoon."');
lines.push('"Oh, of course. What is it?"');
lines.push('Without saying anything, Antony led the way indoors to the office.');
lines.push('It was three o\'clock, and at three o\'clock yesterday Antony and Cayley');
lines.push('had found the body. At a few minutes after three, he had been looking');
lines.push('out of the window of the adjoining room, and had been surprised suddenly');
lines.push('to find the door open and Cayley behind him. He had vaguely wondered at');
lines.push('the time why he had expected the door to be shut, but he had had no time');
lines.push('then to worry the thing out, and he had promised himself to look into');
lines.push('it at his leisure afterwards. Possibly it meant nothing; possibly, if');
lines.push('it meant anything, he could have found out its meaning by a visit to');
lines.push('the office that morning. But he had felt that he would be more likely');
lines.push('to recapture the impressions of yesterday if he chose as far as possible');
lines.push('the same conditions for his experiment. So he had decided that three');
lines.push('o\'clock that afternoon should find him once more in the office.');
lines.push('As he went into the room, followed by Bill, he felt it almost as a shock');
lines.push('that there was now no body of Robert lying there between the two doors.');
lines.push('But there was a dark stain which showed where the dead man\'s head had');
lines.push('been, and Antony knelt down over it, as he had knelt twenty-four hours');
lines.push('before.');
lines.push('"I want to go through it again," he said. "You must be Cayley. Cayley');
lines.push('said he would get some water. I remember thinking that water wasn\'t');
lines.push('much good to a dead man, and that probably he was only too glad to');
lines.push('do anything rather than nothing. He came back with a wet sponge and');
lines.push('a handkerchief. I suppose he got the handkerchief from the chest of');
lines.push('drawers. Wait a bit."');
lines.push('He got up and went into the adjoining room; looked round it, pulled open');
lines.push('a drawer or two, and, after shutting all the doors, came back to the');
lines.push('office.');
lines.push('"The sponge is there, and there are handkerchiefs in the top right-hand');
lines.push('drawer. Now then, Bill, just pretend you\'re Cayley. You\'ve just said');
lines.push('something about water, and you get up."');
lines.push('Feeling that it was all a little uncanny, Bill, who had been kneeling');
lines.push('beside his friend, got up and walked out. Antony, as he had done on the');
lines.push('previous day, looked up after him as he went. Bill turned into the room');
lines.push('on the right, opened the drawer and got the handkerchief, damped the');
lines.push('sponge and came back.');
lines.push('"Well?" he said wonderingly.');
lines.push('Antony shook his head.');
lines.push('"It\'s all different," he said. "For one thing, you made a devil of a');
lines.push('noise and Cayley didn\'t."');
lines.push('"Perhaps you weren\'t listening when Cayley went in?"');
lines.push('"I wasn\'t. But I should have heard him if I could have heard him, and I');
lines.push('should have remembered afterwards."');
lines.push('"Perhaps Cayley shut the door after him."');
lines.push('"Wait!"');
lines.push('He pressed his hand over his eyes and thought. It wasn\'t anything which');
lines.push('he had heard, but something which he had seen. He tried desperately hard');
lines.push('to see it again.... He saw Cayley getting up, opening the door from the');
lines.push('office, leaving it open and walking into the passage, turning to the');
lines.push('door on the right, opening it, going in, and then--What did his eyes see');
lines.push('after that? If they would only tell him again!');
lines.push('Suddenly he jumped up, his face alight. "Bill, I\'ve got it!" he cried.');
lines.push('"What?"');
lines.push('"The shadow on the wall! I was looking at the shadow on the wall. Oh,');
lines.push('ass, and ten times ass!"');
lines.push('Bill looked uncomprehendingly at him. Antony took his arm and pointed to');
lines.push('the wall of the passage.');
lines.push('"Look at the sunlight on it," he said. "That\'s because you\'ve left the');
lines.push('door of that room open. The sun comes straight in through the windows.');
lines.push('Now, I\'m going to shut the door. Look! D\'you see how the shadow moves');
lines.push('across? That\'s what I saw the shadow moving across as the door shut');
lines.push('behind him. Bill, go in and shut the door behind you quite naturally.');
lines.push('Quick!"');
lines.push('Bill went out and Antony knelt, watching eagerly.');
lines.push('"I thought so!" he cried. "I knew it couldn\'t have been that."');
lines.push('"What happened?" said Bill, coming back.');
lines.push('"Just what you would expect. The sunlight came, and the shadow moved');
lines.push('back again all in one movement."');
lines.push('"And what happened yesterday?"');
lines.push('"The sunlight stayed there; and then the shadow came very slowly back,');
lines.push('and there was no noise of the door being shut."');
lines.push('Bill looked at him with startled eyes.');
lines.push('"By Jove! You mean that Cayley closed the door afterwards--as an');
lines.push('afterthought--and very quietly, so that you couldn\'t hear?"');
lines.push('Antony nodded.');
lines.push('"Yes. That explains why I was surprised afterwards when I went into');
lines.push('the room to find the door open behind me. You know how those doors with');
lines.push('springs on them close?"');
lines.push('"The sort which old gentlemen have to keep out draughts?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Just at first they hardly move at all, and then very, very');
lines.push('slowly they swing to-- well, that was the way the shadow moved, and');
lines.push('subconsciously I must have associated it with the movement of that sort');
lines.push('of door. By Jove!" He got up, and dusted his knees. "Now, Bill, just to');
lines.push('make sure, go in and close the door like that. As an afterthought, you');
lines.push('know; and very quietly, so that I don\'t hear the click of it."');
lines.push('Bill did as he was told, and then put his head out eagerly to hear what');
lines.push('had happened.');
lines.push('"That was it," said Antony, with absolute conviction. "That was just');
lines.push('what I saw yesterday." He came out of the office, and joined Bill in the');
lines.push('little room.');
lines.push('"And now," he said, "let\'s try and find out what it was that Mr. Cayley');
lines.push('was doing in here, and why he had to be so very careful that his friend');
lines.push('Mr. Gillingham didn\'t overhear him."');
lines.push('CHAPTER XIII. The Open Window');
lines.push('Anthony\'s first thought was that Cayley had hidden something; something,');
lines.push('perhaps, which he had found by the body, and but that was absurd. In the');
lines.push('time at his disposal, he could have done no more than put it away in a');
lines.push('drawer, where it would be much more open to discovery by Antony than if');
lines.push('he had kept it in his pocket. In any case he would have removed it by');
lines.push('this time, and hidden it in some more secret place. Besides, why in this');
lines.push('case bother about shutting the door?');
lines.push('Bill pulled open a drawer in the chest, and looked inside.');
lines.push('"Is it any good going through these, do you think?" he asked.');
lines.push('Antony looked over his shoulder.');
lines.push('"Why did he keep clothes here at all?" he asked. "Did he ever change');
lines.push('down here?"');
lines.push('"My dear Tony, he had more clothes than anybody in the world. He just');
lines.push('kept them here in case they might be useful, I expect. When you and I');
lines.push('go from London to the country we carry our clothes about with us. Mark');
lines.push('never did. In his flat in London he had everything all over again which');
lines.push('he has here. It was a hobby with him, collecting clothes. If he\'d');
lines.push('had half a dozen houses, they would all have been full of a complete');
lines.push('gentleman\'s town and country outfit."');
lines.push('"I see."');
lines.push('"Of course, it might be useful sometimes, when he was busy in the');
lines.push('next room, not to have to go upstairs for a handkerchief or a more');
lines.push('comfortable coat."');
lines.push('"I see. Yes." He was walking round the room as he answered, and he');
lines.push('lifted the top of the linen basket which stood near the wash basin and');
lines.push('glanced in. "He seems to have come in here for a collar lately."');
lines.push('Bill peered in. There was one collar at the bottom of the basket.');
lines.push('"Yes. I daresay he would," he agreed. "If he suddenly found that the one');
lines.push('he was wearing was uncomfortable or a little bit dirty, or something. He');
lines.push('was very finicking."');
lines.push('Antony leant over and picked it out.');
lines.push('"It must have been uncomfortable this time," he said, after examining it');
lines.push('carefully. "It couldn\'t very well be cleaner." He dropped it back again.');
lines.push('"Anyway, he did come in here sometimes?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes, rather."');
lines.push('"Yes, but what did Cayley come in for so secretly?"');
lines.push('"What did he want to shut the door for?" said Bill. "That\'s what I don\'t');
lines.push('understand. You couldn\'t have seen him, anyhow."');
lines.push('"No. So it follows that I might have heard him. He was going to do');
lines.push('something which he didn\'t want me to hear."');
lines.push('"By Jove, that\'s it!" said Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('"Yes; but what?"');
lines.push('Bill frowned hopefully to himself, but no inspiration came.');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s have some air, anyway," he said at last, exhausted by the');
lines.push('effort, and he went to the window, opened it, and looked out. Then,');
lines.push('struck by an idea, he turned back to Antony and said, "Do you think');
lines.push('I had better go up to the pond to make sure that they\'re still at it?');
lines.push('Because--"');
lines.push('He broke off suddenly at the sight of Antony\'s face.');
lines.push('"Oh, idiot, idiot!" Antony cried. "Oh, most super-excellent of Watsons!');
lines.push('Oh, you lamb, you blessing! Oh, Gillingham, you incomparable ass!"');
lines.push('"What on earth--"');
lines.push('"The window, the window!" cried Antony, pointing to it.');
lines.push('Bill turned back to the window, expecting it to say something. As it');
lines.push('said nothing, he looked at Antony again.');
lines.push('"He was opening the window!" cried Antony.');
lines.push('"Who?"');
lines.push('"Cayley, of course." Very gravely and slowly he expounded. "He came in');
lines.push('here in order to open the window. He shut the door so that I shouldn\'t');
lines.push('hear him open the window. He opened the window. I came in here and found');
lines.push('the window open. I said, \'This window is open. My amazing powers of');
lines.push('analysis tell me that the murderer must have escaped by this window.\'');
lines.push('\'Oh,\' said Cayley, raising his eyebrows. \'Well,\' said he, \'I suppose you');
lines.push('must be right.\' Said I proudly, \'I am. For the window is open,\' I said.');
lines.push('Oh, you incomparable ass!"');
lines.push('He understood now. It explained so much that had been puzzling him.');
lines.push('He tried to put himself in Cayley\'s place--Cayley, when Antony had first');
lines.push('discovered him, hammering at the door and crying, "Let me in!" Whatever');
lines.push('had happened inside the office, whoever had killed Robert, Cayley knew');
lines.push('all about it, and knew that Mark was not inside, and had not escaped by');
lines.push('the window. But it was necessary to Cayley\'s plans--to Mark\'s plans');
lines.push('if they were acting in concert--that he should be thought so to have');
lines.push('escaped. At some time, then, while he was hammering (the key in his');
lines.push('pocket) at the locked door, he must suddenly have remembered--with what');
lines.push('a shock!--that a mistake had been made. A window had not been left open!');
lines.push('Probably it would just have been a horrible doubt at first. Was the');
lines.push('office window open? Surely it was open! Was it?.... Would he have time');
lines.push('now to unlock the door, slip in, open the French windows and slip out');
lines.push('again? No. At any moment the servants might come. It was too risky.');
lines.push('Fatal, if he were discovered. But servants were stupid. He could get');
lines.push('the windows safely open while they were crowding round the body. They');
lines.push('wouldn\'t notice. He could do it somehow.');
lines.push('And then Antony\'s sudden appearance! Here was a complication. And Antony');
lines.push('suggesting that they should try the window! Why, the window was just');
lines.push('what he wanted to avoid. No wonder he had seemed dazed at first.');
lines.push('Ah, and here at last was the explanation why they had gone the longest');
lines.push('way round and yet run. It was Cayley\'s only chance of getting a start');
lines.push('on Antony, of getting to the windows first, of working them open somehow');
lines.push('before Antony caught him up. Even if that were impossible, he must get');
lines.push('there first, just to make sure. Perhaps they were open. He must get away');
lines.push('from Antony and see. And if they were shut, hopelessly shut, then he');
lines.push('must have a moment to himself, a moment in which to think of some other');
lines.push('plan, and avoid the ruin which seemed so suddenly to be threatening.');
lines.push('So he had run. But Antony had kept up with him. They had broken in the');
lines.push('window together, and gone into the office. But Cayley was not done yet.');
lines.push('There was the dressing-room window! But quietly, quietly. Antony mustn\'t');
lines.push('hear.');
lines.push('And Antony didn\'t hear. Indeed, he had played up to Cayley splendidly.');
lines.push('Not only had he called attention to the open window, but he had');
lines.push('carefully explained to Cayley why Mark had chosen this particular window');
lines.push('in preference to the office window. And Cayley had agreed that probably');
lines.push('that was the reason. How he must have chuckled to himself! But he was');
lines.push('still a little afraid. Afraid that Antony would examine the shrubbery.');
lines.push('Why? Obviously because there was no trace of anyone having broken');
lines.push('through the shrubbery. No doubt Cayley had provided the necessary traces');
lines.push('since, and had helped the Inspector to find them. Had he even gone as');
lines.push('far as footmarks in Mark\'s shoes? But the ground was very hard. Perhaps');
lines.push('footmarks were not necessary. Antony smiled as he thought of the big');
lines.push('Cayley trying to squeeze into the dapper little Mark\'s shoes. Cayley');
lines.push('must have been glad that footmarks were not necessary.');
lines.push('No, the open window was enough; the open window and a broken twig or');
lines.push('two. But quietly, quietly. Antony mustn\'t hear. And Antony had not');
lines.push('heard.... But he had seen a shadow on the wall.');
lines.push('They were outside on the lawn again now, Bill and Antony, and Bill was');
lines.push('listening open-mouthed to his friend\'s theory of yesterday\'s happenings.');
lines.push('It fitted in, it explained things, but it did not get them any further.');
lines.push('It only gave them another mystery to solve.');
lines.push('"What\'s that?" said Antony.');
lines.push('"Mark. Where\'s Mark? If he never went into the office at all, then where');
lines.push('is he now?"');
lines.push('"I don\'t say that he never went into the office. In fact, he must have');
lines.push('gone. Elsie heard him." He stopped and repeated slowly, "She heard him,');
lines.push('at least she says she did. But if he was there, he came out again by the');
lines.push('door."');
lines.push('"Well, but where does that lead you?"');
lines.push('"Where it led Mark. The passage."');
lines.push('"Do you mean that he\'s been hiding there all the time?" Antony was');
lines.push('silent until Bill had repeated his question, and then with an effort he');
lines.push('came out of his thoughts and answered him.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know. But look here. Here is a possible explanation. I don\'t');
lines.push('know if it is the right one--I don\'t know, Bill; I\'m rather frightened.');
lines.push('Frightened of what may have happened, of what may be going to happen.');
lines.push('However, here is an explanation. See if you can find any fault with it."');
lines.push('With his legs stretched out and his hands deep in his pockets, he lay');
lines.push('back on the garden-seat, looking up to the blue summer sky above him,');
lines.push('and just as if he saw up there the events of yesterday being enacted');
lines.push('over again, he described them slowly to Bill as they happened.');
lines.push('"We\'ll begin at the moment when Mark shoots Robert. Call it an accident;');
lines.push('probably it was. Mark would say it was, anyhow. He is in a panic,');
lines.push('naturally. But he doesn\'t lock the door and run away. For one thing, the');
lines.push('key is on the outside of the door; for another, he is not quite such a');
lines.push('fool as that. But he is in a horrible position. He is known to be on bad');
lines.push('terms with his brother; he has just uttered some foolish threat to him,');
lines.push('which may possibly have been overheard. What is he to do? He does');
lines.push('the natural thing, the thing which Mark would always do in such');
lines.push('circumstances. He consults Cayley, the invaluable, inevitable Cayley.');
lines.push('"Cayley is just outside, Cayley must have heard the shot, Cayley will');
lines.push('tell him what to do. He opens the door just as Cayley is coming to see');
lines.push('what is the matter. He explains rapidly. \'What\'s to be done, Cay?');
lines.push('What\'s to be done? It was an accident. I swear it was an accident. He');
lines.push('threatened me. He would have shot me if I hadn\'t. Think of something,');
lines.push('quick!\'');
lines.push('"Cayley has thought of something. \'Leave it to me,\' he says. \'You clear');
lines.push('out altogether. I shot him, if you like. I\'ll do all the explaining. Get');
lines.push('away. Hide. Nobody saw you go in. Into the passage, quick. I\'ll come to');
lines.push('you there as soon as I can.\'');
lines.push('"Good Cayley. Faithful Cayley! Mark\'s courage comes back. Cayley');
lines.push('will explain all right. Cayley will tell the servants that it was an');
lines.push('accident. He will ring up the police. Nobody will suspect Cayley--Cayley');
lines.push('has no quarrel with Robert. And then Cayley will come into the passage');
lines.push('and tell him that it is all right, and Mark will go out by the other');
lines.push('end, and saunter slowly back to the house. He will be told the news by');
lines.push('one of the servants. Robert accidentally shot? Good Heavens!');
lines.push('"So, greatly reassured, Mark goes into the library. And Cayley goes to');
lines.push('the door of the office.... and locks it. And then he bangs on the door');
lines.push('and shouts, \'Let me in!\'"');
lines.push('Antony was silent. Bill looked at him and shook his head.');
lines.push('"Yes, Tony, but that doesn\'t make sense. What\'s the point of Cayley');
lines.push('behaving like that?"');
lines.push('Antony shrugged his shoulders without answering.');
lines.push('"And what has happened to Mark since?"');
lines.push('Antony shrugged his shoulders again.');
lines.push('"Well, the sooner we go into that passage, the better," said Bill.');
lines.push('"You\'re ready to go?"');
lines.push('"Quite," said Bill, surprised.');
lines.push('"You\'re quite ready for what we may find?"');
lines.push('"You\'re being dashed mysterious, old boy."');
lines.push('"I know I am." He gave a little laugh, and went on, "Perhaps I\'m being');
lines.push('an ass, just a melodramatic ass. Well, I hope I am." He looked at his');
lines.push('watch.');
lines.push('"It\'s safe, is it? They\'re still busy at the pond?"');
lines.push('"We\'d better make certain. Could you be a sleuthhound, Bill--one of');
lines.push('those that travel on their stomachs very noiselessly? I mean, could you');
lines.push('get near enough to the pond to make sure that Cayley is still there,');
lines.push('without letting him see you?"');
lines.push('"Rather!" He got up eagerly. "You wait."');
lines.push('Antony\'s head shot up suddenly. "Why, that was what Mark said," he');
lines.push('cried.');
lines.push('"Mark?"');
lines.push('"Yes. What Elsie heard him say."');
lines.push('"Oh, that."');
lines.push('"Yes I suppose she couldn\'t have made a mistake, Bill? She did hear');
lines.push('him?"');
lines.push('"She couldn\'t have mistaken his voice, if that\'s what you mean."');
lines.push('"Oh?"');
lines.push('"Mark had an extraordinary characteristic voice."');
lines.push('"Oh!"');
lines.push('"Rather high-pitched, you know, and well, one can\'t explain, but--"');
lines.push('"Yes?"');
lines.push('"Well, rather like this, you know, or even more so if anything." He');
lines.push('rattled these words off in Mark\'s rather monotonous, high-pitched voice,');
lines.push('and then laughed, and added in his natural voice, "I say, that was');
lines.push('really rather good."');
lines.push('Antony nodded quickly. "That was like it?" he said.');
lines.push('"Exactly."');
lines.push('"Yes." He got up and squeezed Bill\'s arm. "Well just go and see about');
lines.push('Cayley, and then we\'ll get moving. I shall be in the library."');
lines.push('"Right."');
lines.push('Bill nodded and walked off in the direction of the pond. This was');
lines.push('glorious fun; this was life. The immediate programme could hardly be');
lines.push('bettered. First of all he was going to stalk Cayley. There was a little');
lines.push('copse above the level of the pond, and about a hundred yards away from');
lines.push('it. He would come into this from the back, creep cautiously through');
lines.push('it, taking care that no twigs cracked, and then, drawing himself on his');
lines.push('stomach to the edge, peer down upon the scene below him. People were');
lines.push('always doing that sort of thing in books, and he had been filled with a');
lines.push('hopeless envy of them; well, now he was actually going to do it himself.');
lines.push('What fun!');
lines.push('And then, when he had got back unobserved to the house and reported to');
lines.push('Antony, they were going to explore the secret passage! Again, what fun!');
lines.push('Unfortunately there seemed to be no chance of buried treasure, but there');
lines.push('might be buried clues. Even if you found nothing, you couldn\'t get away');
lines.push('from the fact that a secret passage was a secret passage, and anything');
lines.push('might happen in it. But even that wasn\'t the end of this exciting day.');
lines.push('They were going to watch the pond that night; they were going to watch');
lines.push('Cayley under the moonlight, watch him as he threw into the silence of');
lines.push('the pond what? The revolver? Well, anyhow, they were going to watch him.');
lines.push('What fun!');
lines.push('To Antony, who was older and who realized into what deep waters they');
lines.push('were getting, it did not seem fun. But it was amazingly interesting.');
lines.push('He saw so much, and yet somehow it was all out of focus. It was like');
lines.push('looking at an opal, and discovering with every movement of it some new');
lines.push('colour, some new gleam of light reflected, and yet never really seeing');
lines.push('the opal as a whole. He was too near it, or too far away; he strained');
lines.push('his eyes and he relaxed his eyes; it was no good. His brain could not');
lines.push('get hold of it.');
lines.push('But there were moments when he almost had it.... and then turned away');
lines.push('from it. He had seen more of life than Bill, but he had never seen');
lines.push('murder before, and this which was in his mind now, and to which he was');
lines.push('afraid to listen, was not just the hot-blooded killing which any man');
lines.push('may come to if he lose control. It was something much more horrible. Too');
lines.push('horrible to be true. Then let him look again for the truth. He looked');
lines.push('again but it was all out of focus.');
lines.push('"I will not look again," he said aloud, as he began to walk towards');
lines.push('the house. "Not yet, anyway." He would go on collecting facts and');
lines.push('impressions. Perhaps the one fact would come along, by itself which');
lines.push('would make everything clear.');
lines.push('CHAPTER XIV. Mr. Beverley Qualifies for the Stage');
lines.push('Bill had come back, and had reported, rather breathless, that Cayley was');
lines.push('still at the pond.');
lines.push('"But I don\'t think they\'re getting up much except mud," he said. "I ran');
lines.push('most of the way back so as to give us as much time as possible."');
lines.push('Antony nodded.');
lines.push('"Well, come along, then," he said. "The sooner, the quicker."');
lines.push('They stood in front of the row of sermons. Antony took down the Reverend');
lines.push('Theodore Ussher\'s famous volume, and felt for the spring. Bill pulled.');
lines.push('The shelves swung open towards them.');
lines.push('"By Jove!" said Bill, "it is a narrow way."');
lines.push('There was an opening about a yard square in front of them, which had');
lines.push('something the look of a brick fireplace, a fireplace raised about two');
lines.push('feet from the ground. But, save for one row of bricks in front, the');
lines.push('floor of it was emptiness. Antony took a torch from his pocket and');
lines.push('flashed it down into the blackness.');
lines.push('"Look," he whispered to the eager Bill. "The steps begin down there. Six');
lines.push('feet down."');
lines.push('He flashed his torch up again. There was a handhold of iron, a sort of');
lines.push('large iron staple, in the bricks in front of them.');
lines.push('"You swing off from there," said Bill. "At least, I suppose you do. I');
lines.push('wonder how Ruth Norris liked doing it."');
lines.push('"Cayley helped her, I should think.... It\'s funny."');
lines.push('"Shall I go first?" asked Bill, obviously longing to do so. Antony shook');
lines.push('his head with a smile.');
lines.push('"I think I will, if you don\'t mind very much, Bill. Just in case."');
lines.push('"In case of what?"');
lines.push('"Well in case."');
lines.push('Bill, had to be content with that, but he was too much excited to wonder');
lines.push('what Antony meant.');
lines.push('"Righto," he said. "Go on."');
lines.push('"Well, we\'ll just make sure we can get back again, first. It really');
lines.push('wouldn\'t be fair on the Inspector if we got stuck down here for the rest');
lines.push('of our lives. He\'s got enough to do trying to find Mark, but if he has');
lines.push('to find you and me as well--"');
lines.push('"We can always get out at the other end."');
lines.push('"Well, we\'re not certain yet. I think I\'d better just go down and back.');
lines.push('I promise faithfully not to explore."');
lines.push('"Right you are."');
lines.push('Antony sat down on the ledge of bricks, swung his feet over, and sat');
lines.push('there for a moment, his legs dangling. He flashed his torch into the');
lines.push('darkness again, so as to make sure where the steps began; then returned');
lines.push('it to his pocket, seized the staple in front of him and swung himself');
lines.push('down. His feet touched the steps beneath him, and he let go.');
lines.push('"Is it all right?" said Bill anxiously.');
lines.push('"All right. I\'ll just go down to the bottom of the steps and back. Stay');
lines.push('there."');
lines.push('The light shone down by his feet. His head began to disappear. For');
lines.push('a little while Bill, craning down the opening, could still see faint');
lines.push('splashes of light, and could hear slow uncertain footsteps; for a little');
lines.push('longer he could fancy that he saw and heard them; then he was alone....');
lines.push('Well, not quite alone. There was a sudden voice in the hall outside.');
lines.push('"Good Lord!" said Bill, turning round with a start, "Cayley!"');
lines.push('If he was not so quick in thought as Antony, he was quick enough in');
lines.push('action. Thought was not demanded now. To close the secret door safely');
lines.push('but noiselessly, to make sure that the books were in the right places,');
lines.push('to move away to another row of shelves so as to be discovered deep in');
lines.push('"Badminton" or "Baedeker" or whomever the kind gods should send to his');
lines.push('aid the difficulty was not to decide what to do, but to do all this in');
lines.push('five seconds rather than in six.');
lines.push('"Ah, there you are," said Cayley from the doorway.');
lines.push('"Hallo!" said Bill, in surprise, looking up from the fourth volume of');
lines.push('"The Life and Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge." "Have they finished?"');
lines.push('"Finished what?"');
lines.push('"The pond," said Bill, wondering why he was reading Coleridge on such');
lines.push('a fine afternoon. Desperately he tried to think of a good reason....');
lines.push('verifying a quotation--an argument with Antony--that would do. But what');
lines.push('quotation?');
lines.push('"Oh, no. They\'re still at it. Where\'s Gillingham?"');
lines.push('\'The Ancient Mariner\'--water, water, everywhere--or was that something');
lines.push('else? And where was Gillingham? Water, water everywhere...');
lines.push('"Tony? Oh, he\'s about somewhere. We\'re just going down to the village.');
lines.push('They aren\'t finding anything at the pond, are they?"');
lines.push('"No. But they like doing it. Something off their minds when they can say');
lines.push('they\'ve done it."');
lines.push('Bill, deep in his book, looked up and said "Yes," and went back to it');
lines.push('again. He was just getting to the place.');
lines.push('"What\'s the book?" said Cayley, coming up to him. Out of the corner of');
lines.push('his eye he glanced at the shelf of sermons as he came. Bill saw that');
lines.push('glance and wondered. Was there anything there to give away the secret?');
lines.push('"I was just looking up a quotation," he drawled. "Tony and I had a');
lines.push('bet about it. You know that thing about--er water, water everywhere,');
lines.push('and--er--not a drop to drink." (But what on earth, he wondered to');
lines.push('himself, were they betting about?)');
lines.push('"\'Nor any drop to drink,\' to be accurate."');
lines.push('Bill looked at him in surprise. Then a happy smile came on his face.');
lines.push('"Quite sure?" he said.');
lines.push('"Of course."');
lines.push('"Then you\'ve saved me a lot of trouble. That\'s, what the bet was about."');
lines.push('He closed the book with a slam, put it back in its shelf, and began');
lines.push('to feel for his pipe and tobacco. "I was a fool to bet with Tony," he');
lines.push('added. "He always knows that sort of thing."');
lines.push('So far, so good. But here was Cayley still in the library, and there was');
lines.push('Antony, all unsuspecting, in the passage. When Antony came back he would');
lines.push('not be surprised to find the door closed, because the whole object of');
lines.push('his going had been to see if he could open it easily from the inside. At');
lines.push('any moment, then, the bookshelf might swing back and show Antony\'s head');
lines.push('in the gap. A nice surprise for Cayley!');
lines.push('"Come with us?" he said casually, as he struck a match. He pulled');
lines.push('vigorously at the flame as he waited for the answer, hoping to hide his');
lines.push('anxiety, for if Cayley assented, he was done.');
lines.push('"I\'ve got to go into Stanton."');
lines.push('Bill blew out a great cloud of smoke with an expiration which covered');
lines.push('also a heartfelt sigh of relief.');
lines.push('"Oh, a pity. You\'re driving, I suppose?"');
lines.push('"Yes. The car will be here directly. There\'s a letter I must write');
lines.push('first." He sat down at a writing table, and took out a sheet of');
lines.push('notepaper.');
lines.push('He was facing the secret door; if it opened he would see it. At any');
lines.push('moment now it might open.');
lines.push('Bill dropped into a chair and thought. Antony must be warned. Obviously.');
lines.push('But how? How did one signal to anybody? By code. Morse code. Did Antony');
lines.push('know it? Did Bill know it himself, if it came to that? He had picked up');
lines.push('a bit in the Army not enough to send a message, of course. But a');
lines.push('message was impossible, anyhow; Cayley would hear him tapping it out. It');
lines.push('wouldn\'t do to send more than a single letter. What letters did he know?');
lines.push('And what letter would convey anything to Antony?.... He pulled at');
lines.push('his pipe, his eyes wandering from Cayley at his desk to the Reverend');
lines.push('Theodore Ussher in his shelf. What letter?');
lines.push('C for Cayley. Would Antony understand? Probably not, but it was');
lines.push('just worth trying. What was C? Long, short, long, short.');
lines.push('Umpty-iddy-umpty-iddy. Was that right? C yes, that was C. He was sure of');
lines.push('that. C. Umpty-iddy-umpty-iddy.');
lines.push('Hands in pockets, he got up and wandered across the room, humming');
lines.push('vaguely to himself, the picture of a man waiting for another man (as it');
lines.push('might be his friend Gillingham) to come in and take him away for a walk');
lines.push('or something. He wandered across to the books at the back of Cayley, and');
lines.push('began to tap absent-mindedly on the shelves, as he looked at the titles.');
lines.push('Umpty-iddy-umpty-iddy. Not that it was much like that at first; he');
lines.push('couldn\'t get the rhythm of it.... Umpt-y-iddy-umpt-y-iddy. That was');
lines.push('better. He was back at Samuel Taylor Coleridge now. Antony would begin');
lines.push('to hear him soon. Umpt-y-iddy-umpt-y-iddy; just the aimless tapping of a');
lines.push('man who is wondering what book he will take out with him to read on');
lines.push('the lawn. Would Antony hear? One always heard the man in the next flat');
lines.push('knocking out his pipe. Would Antony understand? Umpt-y-iddy-umpt-y-iddy.');
lines.push('C. for Cayley, Antony. Cayley\'s here. For God\'s sake, wait.');
lines.push('"Good Lord! Sermons!" said Bill, with a loud laugh.');
lines.push('(Umpt-y-iddy-umpt-y-iddy) "Ever read \'em, Cayley?"');
lines.push('"What?" Cayley looked up suddenly. Bill\'s back moved slowly along, his');
lines.push('fingers beating a tattoo on the shelves as he walked.');
lines.push('"Er no," said Cayley, with a little laugh. An awkward, uncomfortable');
lines.push('little laugh, it seemed to Bill.');
lines.push('"Nor do I." He was past the sermons now past the secret door but still');
lines.push('tapping in the same aimless way.');
lines.push('"Oh, for God\'s sake sit down," burst out Cayley. "Or go outside if you');
lines.push('want to walk about."');
lines.push('Bill turned round in astonishment.');
lines.push('"Hallo, what\'s the matter?"');
lines.push('Cayley was slightly ashamed of his outburst.');
lines.push('"Sorry, Bill," he apologized. "My nerves are on edge. Your constant');
lines.push('tapping and fidgeting about--"');
lines.push('"Tapping?" said Bill with an air of complete surprise.');
lines.push('"Tapping on the shelves, and humming. Sorry. It got on my nerves."');
lines.push('"My dear old chap, I\'m awfully sorry. I\'ll go out in the hall."');
lines.push('"It\'s all right," said Cayley, and went on with his letter. Bill sat');
lines.push('down in his chair again. Had Antony understood? Well, anyhow, there was');
lines.push('nothing to do now but wait for Cayley to go. "And if you ask me," said');
lines.push('Bill to himself, much pleased, "I ought to be on the stage. That\'s where');
lines.push('I ought to be. The complete actor."');
lines.push('A minute, two minutes, three minutes.... five minutes. It was safe now.');
lines.push('Antony had guessed.');
lines.push('"Is the car there?" asked Cayley, as he sealed up his letter.');
lines.push('Bill strolled into the hall, called back "Yes," and went out to talk to');
lines.push('the chauffeur. Cayley joined him, and they stood there for a moment.');
lines.push('"Hallo," said a pleasant voice behind them. They turned round and saw');
lines.push('Antony.');
lines.push('"Sorry to keep you waiting, Bill."');
lines.push('With a tremendous effort Bill restrained his feelings, and said casually');
lines.push('enough that it was all right.');
lines.push('"Well, I must be off," said Cayley. "You\'re going down to the village?"');
lines.push('"That\'s the idea."');
lines.push('"I wonder if you\'d take this letter to Jallands for me?"');
lines.push('"Of course."');
lines.push('"Thanks very much. Well, I shall see you later."');
lines.push('He nodded and got into the car.');
lines.push('As soon as they were alone Bill turned eagerly to his friend.');
lines.push('"Well?" he said excitedly.');
lines.push('"Come into the library."');
lines.push('They went in, and Tony sank down into a chair.');
lines.push('"You must give me a moment," he panted. "I\'ve been running."');
lines.push('"Running?"');
lines.push('"Well, of course. How do you think I got back here?"');
lines.push('"You don\'t mean you went out at the other end?"');
lines.push('Antony nodded.');
lines.push('"I say, did you hear me tapping?"');
lines.push('"I did, indeed. Bill, you\'re a genius."');
lines.push('Bill blushed.');
lines.push('"I knew you\'d understand," he said. "You guessed that I meant Cayley?"');
lines.push('"I did. It was the least I could do after you had been so brilliant. You');
lines.push('must have had rather an exciting time."');
lines.push('"Exciting? Good Lord, I should think it was."');
lines.push('"Tell me about it."');
lines.push('As modestly as possible, Mr. Beverley explained his qualifications for a');
lines.push('life on the stage.');
lines.push('"Good man," said Antony at the end of it. "You are the most perfect');
lines.push('Watson that ever lived. Bill, my lad," he went on dramatically, rising');
lines.push('and taking Bill\'s hand in both of his, "There is nothing that you and I');
lines.push('could not accomplish together, if we gave our minds to it."');
lines.push('"Silly old ass."');
lines.push('"That\'s what you always say when I\'m being serious. Well, anyway, thanks');
lines.push('awfully. You really saved us this time."');
lines.push('"Were you coming back?"');
lines.push('"Yes. At least I think I was. I was just wondering when I heard you');
lines.push('tapping. The fact of the door being shut was rather surprising. Of');
lines.push('course the whole idea was to see if it could be opened easily from the');
lines.push('other side, but I felt somehow that you wouldn\'t shut it until the last');
lines.push('possible moment--until you saw me coming back. Well, then I heard the');
lines.push('taps, and I knew it must mean something, so I sat tight. Then when C');
lines.push('began to come along I said, \'Cayley, b\'Jove\'--bright, aren\'t I?--and I');
lines.push('simply hared to the other end of the passage for all I was worth. And');
lines.push('hared back again. Because I thought you might be getting rather involved');
lines.push('in explanations--about where I was, and so on."');
lines.push('"You didn\'t see Mark, then?"');
lines.push('"No. Nor his--No, I didn\'t see anything."');
lines.push('"Nor what?"');
lines.push('Antony was silent for a moment.');
lines.push('"I didn\'t see anything, Bill. Or rather, I did see something; I saw a');
lines.push('door in the wall, a cupboard. And it\'s locked. So if there\'s anything we');
lines.push('want to find, that\'s where it is."');
lines.push('"Could Mark be hiding there?"');
lines.push('"I called through the keyhole in a whisper \'Mark, are you there?\' he');
lines.push('would have thought it was Cayley. There was no answer.');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s go down and try again. We might be able to get the door');
lines.push('open."');
lines.push('Antony shook his head.');
lines.push('"Aren\'t I going at all?" said Bill in great disappointment.');
lines.push('When Antony spoke, it was to ask another question:');
lines.push('"Can Cayley drive a car?"');
lines.push('"Yes, of course. Why?"');
lines.push('"Then he might easily drop the chauffeur at his lodge and go off to');
lines.push('Stanton, or wherever he wanted to, on his own?"');
lines.push('"I suppose so if he wanted to."');
lines.push('"Yes." Antony got up. "Well, look here, as we said we were going into');
lines.push('the village, and as we promised to leave that letter, I almost think');
lines.push('we\'d better do it."');
lines.push('"Oh!.... Oh, very well."');
lines.push('"Jallands. What were you telling me about that? Oh, yes; the Widow');
lines.push('Norbury."');
lines.push('"That\'s right. Cayley used to be rather keen on the daughter. The');
lines.push('letter\'s for her."');
lines.push('"Yes; well, let\'s take it. Just to be on the safe side."');
lines.push('"Am I going to be done out of that secret passage altogether?" asked');
lines.push('Bill fretfully.');
lines.push('"There\'s nothing to see, really, I promise you."');
lines.push('"You\'re very mysterious. What\'s upset you? You did see something down');
lines.push('there, I\'m certain of it."');
lines.push('"I did and I\'ve told you about it."');
lines.push('"No, you haven\'t. You only told me about the door in the wall."');
lines.push('"That\'s it, Bill. And it\'s locked. And I\'m frightened of what\'s behind');
lines.push('it."');
lines.push('"But then we shall never know what\'s there if we aren\'t going to look."');
lines.push('"We shall know to-night," said Antony, taking Bill\'s arm and leading him');
lines.push('to the hall, "when we watch our dear friend Cayley dropping it into the');
lines.push('pond."');
lines.push('CHAPTER XV. Mrs. Norbury Confides in Dear Mr. Gillingham');
lines.push('They left the road, and took the path across the fields which sloped');
lines.push('gently downwards towards Jallands. Antony was silent, and since it is');
lines.push('difficult to keep up a conversation with a silent man for any length');
lines.push('of time, Bill had dropped into silence too. Or rather, he hummed');
lines.push('to himself, hit at thistles in the grass with his stick and made');
lines.push('uncomfortable noises with his pipe. But he noticed that his companion');
lines.push('kept looking back over his shoulder, almost as if he wanted to remember');
lines.push('for a future occasion the way by which they were coming. Yet there was');
lines.push('no difficulty about it, for they remained all the time in view of the');
lines.push('road, and the belt of trees above the long park wall which bordered its');
lines.push('further side stood out clearly against the sky.');
lines.push('Antony, who had just looked round again, turned back with a smile.');
lines.push('"What\'s the joke?" said Bill, glad of the more social atmosphere.');
lines.push('"Cayley. Didn\'t you see?"');
lines.push('"See what?"');
lines.push('"The car. Going past on the road there."');
lines.push('"So that\'s what you were looking for. You\'ve got jolly good eyes, my');
lines.push('boy, if you recognize the car at this distance after only seeing it');
lines.push('twice."');
lines.push('"Well, I have got jolly good eyes."');
lines.push('"I thought he was going to Stanton."');
lines.push('"He hoped you\'d think so obviously."');
lines.push('"Then where is he going?"');
lines.push('"The library, probably. To consult our friend Ussher. After making');
lines.push('quite sure that his friends Beverley and Gillingham really were going to');
lines.push('Jallands, as they said."');
lines.push('Bill stopped suddenly in the middle of the path.');
lines.push('"I say, do you think so?"');
lines.push('Antony shrugged his shoulders.');
lines.push('"I shouldn\'t be surprised. We must be devilishly inconvenient for him,');
lines.push('hanging about the house. Any moment he can get, when we\'re definitely');
lines.push('somewhere else, must be very useful to him."');
lines.push('"Useful for what?"');
lines.push('"Well, useful for his nerves, if for nothing else. We know he\'s mixed');
lines.push('up in this business; we know he\'s hiding a secret or two. Even if he');
lines.push('doesn\'t suspect that we\'re on his tracks, he must feel that at any');
lines.push('moment we might stumble on something."');
lines.push('Bill gave a grunt of assent, and they went slowly on again.');
lines.push('"What about to-night?" he said, after a lengthy blow at his pipe.');
lines.push('"Try a piece of grass," said Antony, offering it to him. Bill pushed it');
lines.push('through the mouthpiece, blew again, said, "That\'s better," and returned');
lines.push('the pipe to his pocket.');
lines.push('"How are we going to get out without Cayley knowing?"');
lines.push('"Well, that wants thinking over. It\'s going to be difficult. I wish we');
lines.push('were sleeping at the inn.... Is this Miss Norbury, by any chance?"');
lines.push('Bill looked up quickly. They were close to Jallands now, an old thatched');
lines.push('farmhouse which, after centuries of sleep, had woken up to a new world,');
lines.push('and had forthwith sprouted wings; wings, however, of so discreet');
lines.push('a growth that they had not brought with them any obvious change of');
lines.push('character, and Jallands even with a bathroom was still Jallands. To the');
lines.push('outward view, at any rate. Inside, it was more clearly Mrs. Norbury\'s.');
lines.push('"Yes Angela Norbury," murmured Bill. "Not bad-looking, is she?"');
lines.push('The girl who stood by the little white gate of Jallands was something');
lines.push('more than "not bad-looking," but in this matter Bill was keeping');
lines.push('his superlatives for another. In Bill\'s eyes she must be judged, and');
lines.push('condemned, by all that distinguished her from Betty Calladine. To');
lines.push('Antony, unhampered by these standards of comparison, she seemed, quite');
lines.push('simply, beautiful.');
lines.push('"Cayley asked us to bring a letter along," explained Bill, when the');
lines.push('necessary handshakings and introductions were over. "Here you are."');
lines.push('"You will tell him, won\'t you, how dreadfully sorry I am about what');
lines.push('has happened? It seems so hopeless to say anything; so hopeless even to');
lines.push('believe it. If it is true what we\'ve heard."');
lines.push('Bill repeated the outline of events of yesterday.');
lines.push('"Yes.... And Mr. Ablett hasn\'t been found yet?" She shook her head in');
lines.push('distress. "It still seems to have happened to somebody else; somebody we');
lines.push('didn\'t know at all." Then, with a sudden grave smile which included both');
lines.push('of them, "But you must come and have some tea."');
lines.push('"It\'s awfully decent of you," said Bill awkwardly, "but we--er--"');
lines.push('"You will, won\'t you?" she said to Antony.');
lines.push('"Thank you very much."');
lines.push('Mrs. Norbury was delighted to see them, as she always was to see any man');
lines.push('in her house who came up to the necessary standard of eligibility. When');
lines.push('her life-work was completed, and summed up in those beautiful words: "A');
lines.push('marriage has been arranged, and will shortly take place, between Angela,');
lines.push('daughter of the late John Norbury...." then she would utter a grateful');
lines.push('Nunc dimittis and depart in peace to a better world, if Heaven insisted,');
lines.push('but preferably to her new son-in-law\'s more dignified establishment.');
lines.push('For there was no doubt that eligibility meant not only eligibility as a');
lines.push('husband.');
lines.push('But it was not as "eligibles" that the visitors from the Red House were');
lines.push('received with such eagerness to-day, and even if her special smile for');
lines.push('"possibles" was there, it was instinctive rather than reasoned. All that');
lines.push('she wanted at this moment was news--news of Mark. For she was bringing');
lines.push('it off at last; and, if the engagement columns of the "Morning Post"');
lines.push('were preceded, as in the case of its obituary columns, by a premonitory');
lines.push('bulletin, the announcement of yesterday would have cried triumphantly');
lines.push('to the world, or to such part of the world as mattered: "A marriage has');
lines.push('very nearly been arranged (by Mrs. Norbury), and will certainly take');
lines.push('place, between Angela, only daughter of the late John Norbury, and--Mark');
lines.push('Ablett of the Red House." And, coming across it on his way to the');
lines.push('sporting page, Bill would have been surprised. For he had thought that,');
lines.push('if anybody, it was Cayley.');
lines.push('To the girl it was neither. She was often amused by her mother\'s ways;');
lines.push('sometimes ashamed of them; sometimes distressed by them. The Mark Ablett');
lines.push('affair had seemed to her particularly distressing, for Mark was so');
lines.push('obviously in league with her mother against her. Other suitors, upon');
lines.push('whom her mother had smiled, had been embarrassed by that championship;');
lines.push('Mark appeared to depend on it as much as on his own attractions; great');
lines.push('though he thought these to be. They went a-wooing together. It was a');
lines.push('pleasure to turn to Cayley, that hopeless ineligible.');
lines.push('But alas! Cayley had misunderstood her. She could not imagine Cayley in');
lines.push('love until she saw it, and tried, too late, to stop it. That was four');
lines.push('days ago. She had not seen him since, and now here was this letter. She');
lines.push('dreaded opening it. It was a relief to feel that at least she had an');
lines.push('excuse for not doing so while her guests were in the house.');
lines.push('Mrs. Norbury recognized at once that Antony was likely to be the more');
lines.push('sympathetic listener; and when tea was over, and Bill and Angela had');
lines.push('been dispatched to the garden with the promptness and efficiency of');
lines.push('the expert, dear Mr. Gillingham found himself on the sofa beside her,');
lines.push('listening to many things which were of even greater interest to him than');
lines.push('she could possibly have hoped.');
lines.push('"It is terrible, terrible," she said. "And to suggest that dear Mr.');
lines.push('Ablett--"');
lines.push('Antony made suitable noises.');
lines.push('"You\'ve seen Mr. Ablett for yourself. A kinder, more warmhearted man--"');
lines.push('Antony explained that he had not seen Mr. Ablett.');
lines.push('"Of course, yes, I was forgetting. But, believe me, Mr. Gillingham, you');
lines.push('can trust a woman\'s intuition in these matters."');
lines.push('Antony said that he was sure of this.');
lines.push('"Think of my feelings as a mother."');
lines.push('Antony was thinking of Miss Norbury\'s feelings as a daughter, and');
lines.push('wondering if she guessed that her affairs were now being discussed with');
lines.push('a stranger. Yet what could he do? What, indeed, did he want to do except');
lines.push('listen, in the hope of learning? Mark engaged, or about to be engaged!');
lines.push('Had that any bearing on the events of yesterday? What, for instance,');
lines.push('would Mrs. Norbury have thought of brother Robert, that family skeleton?');
lines.push('Was this another reason for wanting brother Robert out of the way?');
lines.push('"I never liked him, never!"');
lines.push('"Never liked?" said Antony, bewildered.');
lines.push('"That cousin of his Mr. Cayley."');
lines.push('"Oh!"');
lines.push('"I ask you, Mr. Gillingham, am I the sort of woman to trust my little');
lines.push('girl to a man who would go about shooting his only brother?"');
lines.push('"I\'m sure you wouldn\'t, Mrs. Norbury."');
lines.push('"If there has been any shooting done, it has been done by somebody');
lines.push('else."');
lines.push('Antony looked at her inquiringly.');
lines.push('"I never liked him," said Mrs. Norbury firmly. "Never." However, thought');
lines.push('Antony to himself, that didn\'t quite prove that Cayley was a murderer.');
lines.push('"How did Miss Norbury get on with him?" he asked cautiously.');
lines.push('"There was nothing in that at all," said Miss Norbury\'s mother');
lines.push('emphatically. "Nothing. I would say so to anybody."');
lines.push('"Oh, I beg your pardon. I never meant--"');
lines.push('"Nothing. I can say that for dear Angela with perfect confidence.');
lines.push('Whether he made advances--" She broke off with a shrug of her plump');
lines.push('shoulders.');
lines.push('Antony waited eagerly.');
lines.push('"Naturally they met. Possibly he might have--I don\'t know. But my duty');
lines.push('as a mother was clear, Mr. Gillingham."');
lines.push('Mr. Gillingham made an encouraging noise.');
lines.push('"I told him quite frankly that--how shall I put it?--that he was');
lines.push('trespassing. Tactfully, of course. But frankly."');
lines.push('"You mean," said Antony, trying to speak calmly, "that you told him');
lines.push('that--er--Mr. Ablett and your daughter--?"');
lines.push('Mrs. Norbury nodded several times.');
lines.push('"Exactly, Mr. Gillingham. I had my duty as a mother."');
lines.push('"I am sure, Mrs. Norbury, that nothing would keep you from doing your');
lines.push('duty. But it must have been disagreeable. Particularly if you weren\'t');
lines.push('quite sure--"');
lines.push('"He was attracted, Mr. Gillingham. Obviously attracted."');
lines.push('"Who would not be?" said Antony, with a charming smile. "It must have');
lines.push('been something of a shock to him to--"');
lines.push('"It was just that which made me so glad that I had spoken. I saw at once');
lines.push('that I had not spoken a moment too soon."');
lines.push('"There must have been a certain awkwardness about the next meeting,"');
lines.push('suggested Antony.');
lines.push('"Naturally, he has not been here since. No doubt they would have been');
lines.push('bound to meet up at the Red House sooner or later."');
lines.push('"Oh,--this was only quite lately?"');
lines.push('"Last week, Mr. Gillingham. I spoke just in time."');
lines.push('"Ah!" said Antony, under his breath. He had been waiting for it.');
lines.push('He would have liked now to have gone away, so that he might have thought');
lines.push('over the new situation by himself; or, perhaps preferably, to have');
lines.push('changed partners for a little while with Bill. Miss Norbury would hardly');
lines.push('be ready to confide in a stranger with the readiness of a mother, but he');
lines.push('might have learnt something by listening to her. For which of them had');
lines.push('she the greater feeling, Cayley or Mark? Was she really prepared to');
lines.push('marry Mark? Did she love him or the other--or neither? Mrs. Norbury was');
lines.push('only a trustworthy witness in regard to her own actions and thoughts;');
lines.push('he had learnt all that was necessary of those, and only the daughter now');
lines.push('had anything left to tell him. But Mrs. Norbury was still talking.');
lines.push('"Girls are so foolish, Mr. Gillingham," she was saying. "It is fortunate');
lines.push('that they have mothers to guide them. It was so obvious to me from the');
lines.push('beginning that dear Mr. Ablett was just the husband for my little girl.');
lines.push('You never knew him?"');
lines.push('Antony said again that he had not seen Mr. Ablett.');
lines.push('"Such a gentleman. So nice-looking, in his artistic way. A regular');
lines.push('Velasquez--I should say Van Dyck. Angela would have it that she could');
lines.push('never marry a man with a beard. As if that mattered, when--" She broke');
lines.push('off, and Antony finished her sentence for her.');
lines.push('"The Red House is certainly charming," he said.');
lines.push('"Charming. Quite charming. And it is not as if Mr. Ablett\'s appearance');
lines.push('were in any way undistinguished. Quite the contrary. I\'m sure you agree');
lines.push('with me?"');
lines.push('Antony said that he had never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Ablett.');
lines.push('"Yes. And quite the centre of the literary and artistic world. So');
lines.push('desirable in every way."');
lines.push('She gave a deep sigh, and communed with herself for a little. Antony');
lines.push('was, about to snatch the opportunity of leaving, when Mrs. Norbury began');
lines.push('again.');
lines.push('"And then there\'s this scapegrace brother of his. He was perfectly frank');
lines.push('with me, Mr. Gillingham. He would be. He told me of this brother, and');
lines.push('I told him that I was quite certain it would make no difference to');
lines.push('my daughter\'s feelings for him.... After all, the brother was in');
lines.push('Australia."');
lines.push('"When was this? Yesterday?" Antony felt that, if Mark had only mentioned');
lines.push('it after his brother\'s announcement of a personal call at the Red House,');
lines.push('this perfect frankness had a good deal of wisdom behind it.');
lines.push('"It couldn\'t have been yesterday, Mr. Gillingham. Yesterday--" she');
lines.push('shuddered, and shook her head.');
lines.push('"I thought perhaps he had been down here in the morning."');
lines.push('"Oh, no! There is such a thing, Mr. Gillingham, as being too devoted a');
lines.push('lover. Not in the morning, no. We both agreed that dear Angela--Oh,');
lines.push('no. No; the day before yesterday, when he happened to drop in about');
lines.push('tea-time."');
lines.push('It occurred to Antony that Mrs. Norbury had come a long way from her');
lines.push('opening statement that Mark and Miss Norbury were practically engaged.');
lines.push('She was now admitting that dear Angela was not to be rushed, that dear');
lines.push('Angela had, indeed, no heart for the match at all.');
lines.push('"The day before yesterday. As it happened, dear Angela was out. Not that');
lines.push('it mattered. He was driving to Middleston. He hardly had time for a cup');
lines.push('of tea, so that even if she had been in--"');
lines.push('Antony nodded absently. This was something new. Why did Mark go to');
lines.push('Middleston the day before yesterday? But, after all, why shouldn\'t he?');
lines.push('A hundred reasons unconnected with the death of Robert might have taken');
lines.push('him there.');
lines.push('He got up to go. He wanted to be alone--alone, at least, with Bill.');
lines.push('Mrs. Norbury had given him many things to think over, but the great');
lines.push('outstanding fact which had emerged was this: that Cayley had reason to');
lines.push('hate Mark,--Mrs. Norbury had given him that reason. To hate? Well, to be');
lines.push('jealous, anyhow. But that was enough.');
lines.push('"You see," he said to Bill, as they walked back, "we know that Cayley is');
lines.push('perjuring himself and risking himself over this business, and that must');
lines.push('be for one of two reasons. Either to save Mark or to endanger him.');
lines.push('That is to say, he is either whole-heartedly for him or whole-heartedly');
lines.push('against him. Well, now we know that he is against him, definitely');
lines.push('against him."');
lines.push('"But, I say, you know," protested Bill, "one doesn\'t necessarily try to');
lines.push('ruin one\'s rival in love."');
lines.push('"Doesn\'t one?" said Antony, turning to him with a smile.');
lines.push('Bill blushed.');
lines.push('"Well, of course, one never knows, but I mean--"');
lines.push('"You mightn\'t try to ruin him, Bill, but you wouldn\'t perjure yourself');
lines.push('in order to get him out of a trouble of his own making."');
lines.push('"Lord! no."');
lines.push('"So that of the two alternatives the other is the more likely."');
lines.push('They had come to the gate into the last field which divided them from');
lines.push('the road, and having gone through it, they turned round and leant');
lines.push('against it, resting for a moment, and looking down at the house which');
lines.push('they had left.');
lines.push('"Jolly little place, isn\'t it?" said Bill.');
lines.push('"Very. But rather mysterious."');
lines.push('"In what way?"');
lines.push('"Well, where\'s the front door?"');
lines.push('"The front door? Why, you\'ve just come out of it."');
lines.push('"But isn\'t there a drive, or a road or anything?"');
lines.push('Bill laughed.');
lines.push('"No; that\'s the beauty of it to some people. And that\'s why it\'s so');
lines.push('cheap, and why the Norburys can afford it, I expect. They\'re not too');
lines.push('well off."');
lines.push('"But what about luggage and tradesmen and that kind of thing?"');
lines.push('"Oh, there\'s a cart-track, but motor-cars can\'t come any nearer than the');
lines.push('road" he turned round and pointed "up there. So the week-end millionaire');
lines.push('people don\'t take it. At least, they\'d have to build a road and a garage');
lines.push('and all the rest of it, if they did."');
lines.push('"I see," said Antony carelessly, and they turned round and continued');
lines.push('their walk up to the road. But later on he remembered this casual');
lines.push('conversation at the gate, and saw the importance of it.');
lines.push('CHAPTER XVI. Getting Ready for the Night');
lines.push('What was it which Cayley was going to hide in that pond that night?');
lines.push('Antony thought that he knew now. It was Mark\'s body.');
lines.push('From the beginning he had seen this answer coming and had drawn back');
lines.push('from it. For, if Mark had been killed, it seemed such a cold-blooded');
lines.push('killing. Was Cayley equal to it? Bill would have said "No," but that was');
lines.push('because he had had breakfast with Cayley, and lunch with him, and dinner');
lines.push('with him; had ragged him and played games with him. Bill would have said');
lines.push('"No," because Bill wouldn\'t have killed anybody in cold blood himself,');
lines.push('and because he took it for granted that other people behaved pretty much');
lines.push('as he did. But Antony had no such illusions. Murders were done; murder');
lines.push('had actually been done here, for there was Robert\'s dead body. Why not');
lines.push('another murder?');
lines.push('Had Mark been in the office at all that afternoon? The only evidence');
lines.push('(other than Cayley\'s, which obviously did not count) was Elsie\'s. Elsie');
lines.push('was quite certain that she had heard his voice. But then Bill had said');
lines.push('that it was a very characteristic voice--an easy voice, therefore, to');
lines.push('imitate. If Bill could imitate it so successfully, why not Cayley?');
lines.push('But perhaps it had not been such a cold-blooded killing, after all.');
lines.push('Suppose Cayley had had a quarrel with his cousin that afternoon over the');
lines.push('girl whom they were both wooing. Suppose Cayley had killed Mark, either');
lines.push('purposely, in sudden passion, or accidentally, meaning only to knock');
lines.push('him down. Suppose that this had happened in the passage, say about');
lines.push('two o\'clock, either because Cayley had deliberately led him there, or');
lines.push('because Mark had casually suggested a visit to it. (One could imagine');
lines.push('Mark continually gloating over that secret passage.) Suppose Cayley');
lines.push('there, with the body at his feet, feeling already the rope round his');
lines.push('neck; his mind darting this way and that in frantic search for a way');
lines.push('of escape; and suppose that suddenly and irrelevantly he remembers');
lines.push('that Robert is coming to the house at three o\'clock that');
lines.push('afternoon--automatically he looks at his watch--in half an hour\'s');
lines.push('time.... In half an hour\'s time. He must think of something quickly,');
lines.push('quickly. Shall he bury the body in the passage and let it be thought');
lines.push('that Mark ran away, frightened at the mere thought of his brother\'s');
lines.push('arrival? But there was the evidence of the breakfast table. Mark had');
lines.push('seemed annoyed at this resurrection of the black sheep, but certainly');
lines.push('not frightened. No; that was much too thin a story. But suppose Mark had');
lines.push('actually seen his brother and had a quarrel with him; suppose it could');
lines.push('be made to look as if Robert had killed Mark--');
lines.push('Antony pictured to himself Cayley in the passage, standing over the dead');
lines.push('body of his cousin, and working it out. How could Robert be made to seem');
lines.push('the murderer, if Robert were alive to deny it? But suppose Robert were');
lines.push('dead, too?');
lines.push('He looks at his watch again. (Only twenty-five minutes now.) Suppose');
lines.push('Robert were dead, too? Robert dead in the office, and Mark dead in the');
lines.push('passage how does that help? Madness! But if the bodies were brought');
lines.push('together somehow and Robert\'s death looked like suicide?.... Was it');
lines.push('possible?');
lines.push('Madness again. Too difficult. (Only twenty minutes now.) Too difficult');
lines.push('to arrange in twenty minutes. Can\'t arrange a suicide. Too difficult....');
lines.push('Only nineteen minutes....');
lines.push('And then the sudden inspiration! Robert dead in the office, Mark\'s body');
lines.push('hidden in the passage--impossible to make Robert seem the murderer, but');
lines.push('how easy to make Mark! Robert dead and Mark missing; why, it jumped to');
lines.push('the eye at once. Mark had killed Robert--accidentally; yes, that would');
lines.push('be more likely--and then had run away. Sudden panic.... (He looks at his');
lines.push('watch again. Fifteen minutes, but plenty of time now. The thing arranges');
lines.push('itself.)');
lines.push('Was that the solution, Antony wondered. It seemed to fit in with the');
lines.push('facts as they knew them; but then, so did that other theory which he had');
lines.push('suggested to Bill in the morning.');
lines.push('"Which one?" said Bill.');
lines.push('They had come back from Jallands through the park and were sitting in');
lines.push('the copse above the pond, from which the Inspector and his fishermen had');
lines.push('now withdrawn. Bill had listened with open mouth to Antony\'s theory, and');
lines.push('save for an occasional "By Jove!" had listened in silence. "Smart man,');
lines.push('Cayley," had been his only comment at the end.');
lines.push('"Which other theory?"');
lines.push('"That Mark had killed Robert accidentally and had gone to Cayley for');
lines.push('help, and that Cayley, having hidden him in the passage, locked the');
lines.push('office door from the outside and hammered on it."');
lines.push('"Yes, but you were so dashed mysterious about that. I asked you what');
lines.push('the point of it was, and you wouldn\'t say anything." He thought for a');
lines.push('little, and then went on, "I suppose you meant that Cayley deliberately');
lines.push('betrayed Mark, and tried to make him look like a murderer?"');
lines.push('"I wanted to warn you that we should probably find Mark in the passage,');
lines.push('alive or dead."');
lines.push('"And now you don\'t think so?"');
lines.push('"Now I think that his dead body is there."');
lines.push('"Meaning that Cayley went down and killed him afterwards after you had');
lines.push('come, after the police had come?"');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s what I shrink from, Bill. It\'s so horribly cold-blooded.');
lines.push('Cayley may be capable of it, but I hate to think of it."');
lines.push('"But, dash it all, your other way is cold-blooded enough. According to');
lines.push('you, he goes up to the office and deliberately shoots a man with whom he');
lines.push('has no quarrel, whom he hasn\'t seen for fifteen years!"');
lines.push('"Yes, but to save his own neck. That makes a difference. My theory is');
lines.push('that he quarrelled violently with Mark over the girl, and killed him in');
lines.push('sudden passion. Anything that happened after that would be self-defense.');
lines.push('I don\'t mean that I excuse it, but that I understand it. And I think');
lines.push('that Mark\'s dead body is in the passage now, and has been there since,');
lines.push('say, half-past two yesterday afternoon. And to-night Cayley is going to');
lines.push('hide it in the pond."');
lines.push('Bill pulled at the moss on the ground beside him, threw away a handful');
lines.push('or two, and said slowly, "You may be right, but it\'s all guess-work, you');
lines.push('know."');
lines.push('Antony laughed.');
lines.push('"Good Lord, of course it is," he said. "And to-night we shall know if');
lines.push('it\'s a good guess or a bad one."');
lines.push('Bill brightened up suddenly.');
lines.push('"To-night," he said. "I say, to-night\'s going to be rather fun. How do');
lines.push('we work it?"');
lines.push('Antony was silent for a little.');
lines.push('"Of course," he said at last, "we ought to inform the police, so that');
lines.push('they can come here and watch the pond to-night."');
lines.push('"Of course," grinned Bill.');
lines.push('"But I think that perhaps it is a little early to put our theories');
lines.push('before them."');
lines.push('"I think perhaps it is," said Bill solemnly.');
lines.push('Antony looked up at him with a sudden smile.');
lines.push('"Bill, you old bounder."');
lines.push('"Well, dash it, it\'s our show. I don\'t see why we shouldn\'t get our');
lines.push('little bit of fun out of it."');
lines.push('"Neither do I. All right, then, we\'ll do without the police to-night."');
lines.push('"We shall miss them," said Bill sadly, "but \'tis better so."');
lines.push('There were two problems in front of them: first, the problem of getting');
lines.push('out of the house without being discovered by Cayley, and secondly, the');
lines.push('problem of recovering whatever it was which Cayley dropped into the pond');
lines.push('that night.');
lines.push('"Let\'s look at it from Cayley\'s point of view," said Antony. "He may not');
lines.push('know that we\'re on his track, but he can\'t help being suspicious of');
lines.push('us. He\'s bound to be suspicious of everybody in the house, and more');
lines.push('particularly of us, because we\'re presumably more intelligent than the');
lines.push('others."');
lines.push('He stopped for a moment to light his pipe, and Bill took the opportunity');
lines.push('of looking more intelligent than Mrs. Stevens.');
lines.push('"Now, he has got something to hide to-night, and he\'s going to take good');
lines.push('care that we aren\'t watching him. Well, what will he do?"');
lines.push('"See that we are asleep first, before he starts out."');
lines.push('"Yes. Come and tuck us up, and see that we\'re nice and comfortable."');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s awkward," said Bill. "But we could lock our doors, and then');
lines.push('he wouldn\'t know that we weren\'t there."');
lines.push('"Have you ever locked your door?"');
lines.push('"Never."');
lines.push('"No. And you can bet that Cayley knows that. Anyway, he\'d bang on it,');
lines.push('and you wouldn\'t answer, and then what would he think?"');
lines.push('Bill was silent; crushed.');
lines.push('"Then I don\'t see how we\'re going to do it," he said, after deep');
lines.push('thought. "He\'ll obviously come to us just before he starts out, and that');
lines.push('doesn\'t give us time to get to the pond in front of him."');
lines.push('"Let\'s put ourselves in his place," said Antony, puffing slowly at his');
lines.push('pipe. "He\'s got the body, or whatever it is, in the passage. He won\'t');
lines.push('come up the stairs, carrying it in his arms, and look in at our doors to');
lines.push('see if we\'re awake. He\'ll have to make sure about us first, and then go');
lines.push('down for the body afterwards. So that gives us a little time."');
lines.push('"Y-yes," said Bill doubtfully. "We might just do it, but it\'ll be a bit');
lines.push('of a rush."');
lines.push('"But wait. When he\'s gone down to the passage and got the body, what');
lines.push('will he do next?"');
lines.push('"Come out again," said Bill helpfully.');
lines.push('"Yes; but which end?"');
lines.push('Bill sat up with a start.');
lines.push('"By Jove, you mean that he will go out at the far end by the');
lines.push('bowling-green?"');
lines.push('"Don\'t you think so? Just imagine him walking across the lawn in full');
lines.push('view of the house, at midnight, with a body in his arms. Think of');
lines.push('the awful feeling he would have in the back of the neck, wondering if');
lines.push('anybody, any restless sleeper, had chosen just that moment to wander');
lines.push('to the window and look out into the night. There\'s still plenty of');
lines.push('moonlight, Bill. Is he going to walk across the park in the moonlight,');
lines.push('with all those windows staring at him? Not if he can help it. But he');
lines.push('can get out by the bowling green, and then come to the pond without ever');
lines.push('being in sight of the house, at all."');
lines.push('"You\'re right. And that will just about give us time. Good. Now, what\'s');
lines.push('the next thing?"');
lines.push('"The next thing is to mark the exact place in the pond where he drops');
lines.push('whatever he drops."');
lines.push('"So that we can fish it out again."');
lines.push('"If we can see what it is, we shan\'t want to. The police can have a');
lines.push('go at it to-morrow. But if it\'s something we can\'t identify from a');
lines.push('distance, then we must try and get it out. To see whether it\'s worth');
lines.push('telling the police about."');
lines.push('"Y-yes," said Bill, wrinkling his forehead. "Of course, the trouble with');
lines.push('water is that one bit of it looks pretty much like the next bit. I don\'t');
lines.push('know if that had occurred to you.');
lines.push('"It had," smiled Antony. "Let\'s come and have a look at it."');
lines.push('They walked to the edge of the copse, and lay down there in silence,');
lines.push('looking at the pond beneath them.');
lines.push('"See anything?" said Antony at last.');
lines.push('"What?"');
lines.push('"The fence on the other side."');
lines.push('"What about it?"');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s rather useful, that\'s all."');
lines.push('"Said Sherlock Holmes enigmatically," added Bill. "A moment later, his');
lines.push('friend Watson had hurled him into the pond."');
lines.push('Antony laughed.');
lines.push('"I love being Sherlocky," he said. "It\'s very unfair of you not to play');
lines.push('up to me."');
lines.push('"Why is that fence useful, my dear Holmes?" said Bill obediently.');
lines.push('"Because you can take a bearing on it. You see--"');
lines.push('"Yes, you needn\'t stop to explain to me what a bearing is."');
lines.push('"I wasn\'t going to. But you\'re lying here," he looked up "underneath');
lines.push('this pine-tree. Cayley comes out in the old boat and drops his parcel');
lines.push('in. You take a line from here on to the boat, and mark it off on the');
lines.push('fence there. Say it\'s the fifth post from the end. Well, then I take a');
lines.push('line from my tree we\'ll find one for me directly and it comes on to');
lines.push('the twentieth post, say. And where the two lines meet, there shall');
lines.push('the eagles be gathered together. Q.E.D. And there, I almost forgot to');
lines.push('remark, will the taller eagle, Beverley by name, do his famous diving');
lines.push('act. As performed nightly at the Hippodrome."');
lines.push('Bill looked at him uneasily.');
lines.push('"I say, really? It\'s beastly dirty water, you know."');
lines.push('"I\'m afraid so, Bill. So it is written in the book of Jasher."');
lines.push('"Of course I knew that one of us would have to, but I hoped, well, it\'s');
lines.push('a warm night."');
lines.push('"Just the night for a bathe," agreed Antony, getting up. "Well now,');
lines.push('let\'s have a look for my tree."');
lines.push('They walked down to the margin of the pond and then looked back. Bill\'s');
lines.push('tree stood up and took the evening, tall and unmistakable, fifty feet');
lines.push('nearer to heaven than its neighbours. But it had its fellow at the other');
lines.push('end of the copse, not quite so tall, perhaps, but equally conspicuous.');
lines.push('"That\'s where I shall be," said Antony, pointing to it. "Now, for the');
lines.push('Lord\'s sake, count your posts accurately."');
lines.push('"Thanks very much, but I shall do it for my own sake," said Bill with');
lines.push('feeling. "I don\'t want to spend the whole night diving."');
lines.push('"Fix on the post in a straight line with you and the splash, and then');
lines.push('count backwards to the beginning of the fence."');
lines.push('"Right, old boy. Leave it to me. I can do this on my head."');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s how you will have to do the last part of it," said Antony');
lines.push('with a smile.');
lines.push('He looked at his watch. It was nearly time to change for dinner. They');
lines.push('started to walk back to the house together.');
lines.push('"There\'s one thing which worries me rather," said Antony. "Where does');
lines.push('Cayley sleep?"');
lines.push('"Next door to me. Why?"');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s just possible that he might have another look at you after');
lines.push('he\'s come back from the pond. I don\'t think he\'d bother about it in the');
lines.push('ordinary way, but if he is actually passing your door, I think he might');
lines.push('glance in."');
lines.push('"I shan\'t be there. I shall be at the bottom of the pond, sucking up');
lines.push('mud."');
lines.push('"Yes.... Do you think you could leave something in your bed that looked');
lines.push('vaguely like you in the dark? A bolster with a pyjama-coat round it, and');
lines.push('one arm outside the blanket, and a pair of socks or something for the');
lines.push('head. You know the kind of thing. I think it would please him to feel');
lines.push('that you were still sleeping peacefully."');
lines.push('Bill chuckled to himself.');
lines.push('"Rather. I\'m awfully good at that. I\'ll make him up something really');
lines.push('good. But what about you?"');
lines.push('"I\'m at the other end of the house; he\'s hardly likely to bother about');
lines.push('me a second time. And I shall be so very fast asleep at his first visit.');
lines.push('Still, I may as well to be on the safe side."');
lines.push('They went into the house. Cayley was in the hall as they came in. He');
lines.push('nodded, and took out his watch.');
lines.push('"Time to change?" he said.');
lines.push('"Just about," said Bill.');
lines.push('"You didn\'t forget my letter?"');
lines.push('"I did not. In fact, we had tea there."');
lines.push('"Ah!" He looked away and said carelessly, "How were they all?"');
lines.push('"They sent all sorts of sympathetic messages to you, and--and all that');
lines.push('sort of thing."');
lines.push('"Oh, yes."');
lines.push('Bill waited for him to say something more, and then, as nothing');
lines.push('was coming, he turned round, said, "Come on, Tony," and led the way');
lines.push('upstairs.');
lines.push('"Got all you want?" he said at the top of the stairs.');
lines.push('"I think so. Come and see me before you go down."');
lines.push('"Righto."');
lines.push('Antony shut his bedroom door behind him and walked over to the window.');
lines.push('He pushed open a casement and looked out. His bedroom was just over');
lines.push('the door at the back of the house. The side wall of the office, which');
lines.push('projected out into the lawn beyond the rest of the house, was on his');
lines.push('left. He could step out on to the top of the door, and from there drop');
lines.push('easily to the ground. Getting back would be little more difficult. There');
lines.push('was a convenient water-pipe which would help.');
lines.push('He had just finished his dressing when Bill came in. "Final');
lines.push('instructions?" he asked, sitting down on the bed. "By the way, how are');
lines.push('we amusing ourselves after dinner? I mean immediately after dinner."');
lines.push('"Billiards?"');
lines.push('"Righto. Anything you like."');
lines.push('"Don\'t talk too loud," said Antony in a lower voice. "We\'re more or less');
lines.push('over the hall, and Cayley may be there." He led the way to the window.');
lines.push('"We\'ll go out this way to-night. Going downstairs is too risky. It\'s');
lines.push('easy enough; better put on tennis-shoes."');
lines.push('"Right. I say, in case I don\'t get another chance alone with you what do');
lines.push('I do when Cayley comes to tuck me up?"');
lines.push('"It\'s difficult to say. Be as natural as you can. I mean, if he just');
lines.push('knocks lightly and looks in, be asleep. Don\'t overdo the snoring. But');
lines.push('if he makes a hell of a noise, you\'ll have to wake up and rub your eyes,');
lines.push('and wonder what on earth he\'s doing in your room at all. You know the');
lines.push('sort of thing."');
lines.push('"Right. And about the dummy figure. I\'ll make it up directly we come');
lines.push('upstairs, and hide it under the bed."');
lines.push('"Yes.... I think we\'d better go completely to bed ourselves. We shan\'t');
lines.push('take a moment dressing again, and it will give him time to get safely');
lines.push('into the passage. Then come into my room."');
lines.push('"Right.... Are you ready?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('They went downstairs together.');
lines.push('CHAPTER XVII. Mr. Beverley Takes the Water');
lines.push('Cayley seemed very fond of them that night. After dinner was over, he');
lines.push('suggested a stroll outside. They walked up and down the gravel in front');
lines.push('of the house, saying very little to each other, until Bill could');
lines.push('stand it no longer. For the last twenty turns he had been slowing down');
lines.push('hopefully each time they came to the door, but the hint had always been');
lines.push('lost on his companions, and each time another turn had been taken. But');
lines.push('in the end he had been firm.');
lines.push('"What about a little billiards?" he said, shaking himself free from the');
lines.push('others.');
lines.push('"Will you play?" said Antony to Cayley.');
lines.push('"I\'ll watch you," he said, and he had watched them resolutely until the');
lines.push('game, and then another game after that, had been played.');
lines.push('They went into the hall and attacked the drinks.');
lines.push('"Well, thank heaven for bed," said Bill; putting down his glass. "Are');
lines.push('you coming?"');
lines.push('"Yes," said Antony, and finished his drink. He looked at Cayley.');
lines.push('"I\'ve just got one or two little things to do," said Cayley. "I shan\'t');
lines.push('be long following you."');
lines.push('"Well, good night, then."');
lines.push('"Good night."');
lines.push('"Good night," called Bill from half-way up the stairs. "Good night,');
lines.push('Tony."');
lines.push('"Good night."');
lines.push('Bill looked at his watch. Half-past eleven. Not much chance of anything');
lines.push('happening for another hour. He pulled open a drawer and wondered what');
lines.push('to wear on their expedition. Grey flannel trousers, flannel shirt, and');
lines.push('a dark coat; perhaps a sweater, as they might be lying out in the copse');
lines.push('for some time. And good idea a towel. He would want it later on, and');
lines.push('meanwhile he could wear it round his waist.');
lines.push('Tennis-shoes.... There. Everything was ready. Now then for the dummy');
lines.push('figure.');
lines.push('He looked at his watch again before getting into bed. Twelve-fifteen.');
lines.push('How long to wait before Cayley came up? He turned out the light, and');
lines.push('then, standing by the door in his pyjamas, waited for his eyes to become');
lines.push('accustomed to the new darkness.... He could only just make out the bed');
lines.push('in the corner of the room. Cayley would want more light than that if');
lines.push('he were to satisfy himself from the door that the bed was occupied. He');
lines.push('pulled the curtains a little way back. That was about right. He could');
lines.push('have another look later on, when he had the dummy figure in the bed.');
lines.push('How long would it be before Cayley came up? It wasn\'t that he wanted his');
lines.push('friends, Beverley and Gillingham, to be asleep before he started on his');
lines.push('business at the pond; all that he wanted was to be sure that they were');
lines.push('safely in their bedrooms. Cayley\'s business would make no noise, give');
lines.push('no sign, to attract the most wakeful member of the household, so long as');
lines.push('the household was really inside the house. But if he wished to reassure');
lines.push('himself about his guests, he would have to wait until they were far');
lines.push('enough on their way to sleep not to be disturbed by him as he came up');
lines.push('to reassure himself. So it amounted to the same thing, really. He would');
lines.push('wait until they were asleep.... until they were asleep.... asleep....');
lines.push('With a great effort Bill regained the mastery over his wandering');
lines.push('thoughts and came awake again. This would never do. It would be fatal if');
lines.push('he went to sleep.... if he went to sleep.... to sleep .... And then, in');
lines.push('an instant, he was intensely awake. Suppose Cayley never came at all!');
lines.push('Suppose Cayley was so unsuspicious that, as soon as they had gone');
lines.push('upstairs, he had dived down into the passage and set about his business.');
lines.push('Suppose, even now, he was at the pond, dropping into it that secret of');
lines.push('his. Good heavens, what fools they had been! How could Antony have taken');
lines.push('such a risk? Put yourself in Cayley\'s place, he had said. But how was');
lines.push('it possible? They weren\'t Cayley. Cayley was at the pond now. They would');
lines.push('never know what he had dropped into it.');
lines.push('Listen!.... Somebody at the door. He was asleep. Quite naturally now.');
lines.push('Breathe a little more loudly, perhaps. He was asleep.... The door was');
lines.push('opening. He could feel it opening behind him.... Good Lord, suppose');
lines.push('Cayley really was a murderer! Why, even now he might be--no, he mustn\'t');
lines.push('think of that. If he thought of that, he would have to turn round.');
lines.push('He mustn\'t turn round. He was asleep; just peacefully asleep. But why');
lines.push('didn\'t the door shut? Where was Cayley now? Just behind him? And in his');
lines.push('hand no, he mustn\'t think of that. He was asleep. But why didn\'t the');
lines.push('door shut?');
lines.push('The door was shutting. There was a sigh from the sleeper in the bed,');
lines.push('a sigh of relief which escaped him involuntarily. But it had a very');
lines.push('natural sound--a deep breath from a heavy sleeper. He added another one');
lines.push('to it to make it seem more natural. The door was shut.');
lines.push('Bill counted a hundred slowly and then got up. As quickly and as');
lines.push('noiselessly as possible he dressed himself in the dark. He put the dummy');
lines.push('figure in the bed, arranged the clothes so that just enough but not');
lines.push('too much of it was showing, and stood by the door looking at it. For a');
lines.push('casual glance the room was just about light enough. Then very quietly,');
lines.push('very slowly he opened the door. All was still. There was no light from');
lines.push('beneath the door of Cayley\'s room. Very quietly, very carefully he crept');
lines.push('along the passage to Antony\'s room. He opened the door and went in.');
lines.push('Antony was still in bed. Bill walked across to wake him up, and then');
lines.push('stopped rigid, and his heart thumped against his ribs. There was');
lines.push('somebody else in the room.');
lines.push('"All right, Bill," said a whispering voice, and Antony stepped out from');
lines.push('the curtains.');
lines.push('Bill gazed at him without saying anything.');
lines.push('"Rather good, isn\'t it?" said Antony, coming closer and pointing to the');
lines.push('bed. "Come on; the sooner we get out now, the better."');
lines.push('He led the way out of the window, the silent Bill following him. They');
lines.push('reached the ground safely and noiselessly, went quickly across the lawn');
lines.push('and so, over the fence, into the park. It was not until they were out of');
lines.push('sight of the house that Bill felt it safe to speak.');
lines.push('"I quite thought it was you in bed," he said.');
lines.push('"I hoped you would. I shall be rather disappointed now if Cayley doesn\'t');
lines.push('call again. It\'s a pity to waste it."');
lines.push('"He came all right just now?"');
lines.push('"Oh, rather. What about you?"');
lines.push('Bill explained his feelings picturesquely.');
lines.push('"There wouldn\'t have been much point in his killing you," said Antony');
lines.push('prosaically. "Besides being too risky."');
lines.push('"Oh!" said Bill. And then, "I had rather hoped that it was his love for');
lines.push('me which restrained him."');
lines.push('Antony laughed.');
lines.push('"I doubt it.... You didn\'t turn up your light when you dressed?"');
lines.push('"Good Lord, no. Did you want me to?"');
lines.push('Antony laughed again and took him by the arm.');
lines.push('"You\'re a splendid conspirator, Bill. You and I could take on anything');
lines.push('together."');
lines.push('The pond was waiting for them, more solemn in the moonlight. The trees');
lines.push('which crowned the sloping bank on the far side of it were mysteriously');
lines.push('silent. It seemed that they had the world very much to themselves.');
lines.push('Almost unconsciously Antony spoke in a whisper.');
lines.push('"There\'s your tree, there\'s mine. As long as you don\'t move, there\'s no');
lines.push('chance of his seeing you. After he\'s gone, don\'t come out till I do. He');
lines.push('won\'t be here for a quarter of an hour or so, so don\'t be impatient."');
lines.push('"Righto," whispered Bill.');
lines.push('Antony gave him a nod and a smile, and they walked off to their posts.');
lines.push('The minutes went by slowly. To Antony, lying hidden in the undergrowth');
lines.push('at the foot of his tree, a new problem was presenting itself. Suppose');
lines.push('Cayley had to make more than one journey that night? He might come back');
lines.push('to find them in the boat; one of them, indeed, in the water. And if they');
lines.push('decided to wait in hiding, on the chance of Cayley coming back again,');
lines.push('what was the least time they could safely allow? Perhaps it would be');
lines.push('better to go round to the front of the house and watch for his return');
lines.push('there, the light in his bedroom, before conducting their experiments at');
lines.push('the pond. But then they might miss his second visit in this way, if he');
lines.push('made a second visit. It was difficult.');
lines.push('His eyes were fixed on the boat as he considered these things, and');
lines.push('suddenly, as if materialized from nowhere, Cayley was standing by the');
lines.push('boat. In his hand was a small brown bag.');
lines.push('Cayley put the bag in the bottom of the boat, stepped in, and using an');
lines.push('oar as a punt-pole, pushed slowly off. Then, very silently, he rowed');
lines.push('towards the middle of the pond.');
lines.push('He had stopped. The oars rested on the water. He picked up the bag from');
lines.push('between his feet, leant over the nose of the boat, and rested it lightly');
lines.push('on the water for a moment. Then he let go. It sank slowly. He waited');
lines.push('there, watching; afraid, perhaps, that it might rise again. Antony began');
lines.push('to count....');
lines.push('And now Cayley was back at his starting-place. He tied up the boat,');
lines.push('looked carefully round to see that he had left no traces behind him,');
lines.push('and then turned to the water again. For a long time, as it seemed to the');
lines.push('watchers, he stood there, very big, very silent, in the moonlight. At');
lines.push('last he seemed satisfied. Whatever his secret was, he had hidden it; and');
lines.push('so with a gentle sigh, as unmistakable to Antony as if he had heard it,');
lines.push('Cayley turned away and vanished again as quietly as he had come.');
lines.push('Antony gave him three minutes, and stepped out from the trees. He waited');
lines.push('there for Bill to join him.');
lines.push('"Six," whispered Bill.');
lines.push('Antony nodded.');
lines.push('"I\'m going round to the front of the house. You get back to your tree');
lines.push('and watch, in case Cayley comes again. Your bedroom is the left-hand end');
lines.push('one, and Cayley\'s the end but one? Is that right?"');
lines.push('Bill nodded.');
lines.push('"Right. Wait in hiding till I come back. I don\'t know how long I shall');
lines.push('be, but don\'t be impatient. It will seem longer than it is." He patted');
lines.push('Bill on the shoulder, and with a smile and a nod of the head he left him');
lines.push('there.');
lines.push('What was in the bag? What could Cayley want to hide other than a key or');
lines.push('a revolver? Keys and revolvers sink of themselves; no need to put them');
lines.push('in a bag first. What was in the bag? Something which wouldn\'t sink of');
lines.push('itself; something which needed to be helped with stones before it would');
lines.push('hide itself safely in the mud.');
lines.push('Well, they would find that out. There was no object in worrying about');
lines.push('it now. Bill had a dirty night\'s work in front of him. But where was the');
lines.push('body which Antony had expected so confidently or, if there were no body,');
lines.push('where was Mark?');
lines.push('More immediately, however, where was Cayley? As quickly as he could');
lines.push('Antony had got to the front of the house and was now lying in the');
lines.push('shrubbery which bordered the lawn, waiting for the light to go up');
lines.push('in Cayley\'s window. If it went up in Bill\'s window, then they were');
lines.push('discovered. It would mean that Cayley had glanced into Bill\'s room, had');
lines.push('been suspicious of the dummy figure in the bed, and had turned up the');
lines.push('light to make sure. After that, it was war between them. But if it went');
lines.push('up in Cayley\'s room--');
lines.push('There was a light. Antony felt a sudden thrill of excitement. It was in');
lines.push('Bill\'s room. War!');
lines.push('The light stayed there, shining vividly, for a wind had come up, blowing');
lines.push('the moon behind a cloud, and casting a shadow over the rest of the');
lines.push('house. Bill had left his curtains undrawn. It was careless of him; the');
lines.push('first stupid thing he had done, but--');
lines.push('The moon slipped out again.... and Antony laughed to himself in the');
lines.push('bushes. There was another window beyond Cayley\'s, and there was no light');
lines.push('in it. The declaration of war was postponed.');
lines.push('Antony lay there, watching Cayley into bed. After all it was only polite');
lines.push('to return Cayley\'s own solicitude earlier in the night. Politeness');
lines.push('demanded that one should not disport oneself on the pond until one\'s');
lines.push('friends were comfortably tucked up.');
lines.push('Meanwhile Bill was getting tired of waiting. His chief fear was that he');
lines.push('might spoil everything by forgetting the number "six." It was the sixth');
lines.push('post. Six. He broke off a twig and divided it into six pieces. These');
lines.push('he arranged on the ground in front of him. Six. He looked at the pond,');
lines.push('counted up to the sixth post, and murmured "six" to himself again. Then');
lines.push('he looked down at his twigs. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven. Seven!');
lines.push('Was it seven? Or was that seventh bit of a twig an accidental bit which');
lines.push('had been on the ground anyhow? Surely it was six! Had he said "six"');
lines.push('to Antony? If so, Antony would remember, and it was all right. Six.');
lines.push('He threw away the seventh twig and collected the other six together.');
lines.push('Perhaps they would be safer in his pocket. Six. The height of a tall');
lines.push('man--well, his own height. Six feet. Yes, that was the way to remember');
lines.push('it. Feeling a little safer on the point, he began to wonder about the');
lines.push('bag, and what Antony would say to it, and the possible depth of the');
lines.push('water and of the mud at the bottom; and was still so wondering, and');
lines.push('saying, "Good Lord, what a life!" to himself, when Antony reappeared.');
lines.push('Bill got up and came down the slope to meet him.');
lines.push('"Six," he said firmly. "Sixth post from the end."');
lines.push('"Good," smiled Antony. "Mine was the eighteenth--a little way past it."');
lines.push('"What did you go off for?"');
lines.push('"To see Cayley into bed."');
lines.push('"Is it all right?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Better hang your coat over the sixth post, and then we shall');
lines.push('see it more easily. I\'ll put mine on the eighteenth. Are you going to');
lines.push('undress here or in the boat?"');
lines.push('"Some here, and some in the boat. You\'re quite sure that you wouldn\'t');
lines.push('like to do the diving yourself?"');
lines.push('"Quite, thanks."');
lines.push('They had walked round to the other side of the pond. Coming to the sixth');
lines.push('post of the fence, Bill took off his coat and put it in position,');
lines.push('and then finished his undressing, while Antony went off to mark the');
lines.push('eighteenth post. When they were ready, they got into the boat, Antony');
lines.push('taking the oars.');
lines.push('"Now, Bill, tell me as soon as I\'m in a line with your two marks."');
lines.push('He rowed slowly towards the middle of the pond.');
lines.push('"You\'re about there now," said Bill at last.');
lines.push('Antony stopped rowing and looked about him.');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s pretty well right." He turned the boat\'s nose round until');
lines.push('it was pointing to the pine-tree under which Bill had lain. "You see my');
lines.push('tree and the other coat?"');
lines.push('"Yes," said Bill.');
lines.push('"Right. Now then, I\'m going to row gently along this line until we\'re');
lines.push('dead in between the two. Get it as exact as you can--for your own sake."');
lines.push('"Steady!" said Bill warningly. "Back a little.... a little more .... a');
lines.push('little more forward again.... Right." Antony left the oars on the water');
lines.push('and looked around. As far as he could tell, they were in an exact line');
lines.push('with each pair of landmarks.');
lines.push('"Now then, Bill, in you go."');
lines.push('Bill pulled off his shirt and trousers, and stood up.');
lines.push('"You mustn\'t dive from the boat, old boy," said Antony hastily. "You\'ll');
lines.push('shift its position. Slide in gently."');
lines.push('Bill slid in from the stern and swam slowly round to Antony.');
lines.push('"What\'s it like?" said Antony.');
lines.push('"Cold. Well, here\'s luck to it."');
lines.push('He gave a sudden kick, flashed for a moment in the water, and was gone.');
lines.push('Antony steadied the boat, and took another look at his landmarks.');
lines.push('Bill came up behind him with a loud explosion. "It\'s pretty muddy," he');
lines.push('protested.');
lines.push('"Weeds?"');
lines.push('"No, thank the Lord."');
lines.push('"Well, try again."');
lines.push('Bill gave another kick and disappeared. Again Antony coaxed the boat');
lines.push('back into position, and again Bill popped up, this time in front of him.');
lines.push('"I feel that if I threw you a sardine," said Antony, with a smile,');
lines.push('"you\'d catch it in your mouth quite prettily."');
lines.push('"It\'s awfully easy to be funny from where you are. How much longer have');
lines.push('I got to go on doing this?"');
lines.push('Antony looked at his watch.');
lines.push('"About three hours. We must get back before daylight. But be quicker if');
lines.push('you can, because it\'s rather cold for me sitting here."');
lines.push('Bill flicked a handful of water at him and disappeared again. He was');
lines.push('under for almost a minute this time, and there was a grin on his face');
lines.push('when it was visible again.');
lines.push('"I\'ve got it, but it\'s devilish hard to get up. I\'m not sure that it');
lines.push('isn\'t too heavy for me."');
lines.push('"That\'s all right," said Antony. He brought out a ball of thick string');
lines.push('from his pocket. "Get this through the handle if you can, and then we');
lines.push('can both pull."');
lines.push('"Good man." He paddled to the side, took one end of the string and');
lines.push('paddled back again. "Now then."');
lines.push('Two minutes later the bag was safely in the boat. Bill clambered in');
lines.push('after it, and Antony rowed back. "Well done, Watson," he said quietly,');
lines.push('as they landed. He fetched their two coats, and then waited, the bag in');
lines.push('his hand, while Bill dried and dressed himself. As soon as the latter');
lines.push('was ready, he took his arm and led him into the copse. He put the bag');
lines.push('down and felt in his pockets.');
lines.push('"I shall light a pipe before I open it," he said. "What about you?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('With great care they filled and lit their pipes. Bill\'s hand was a');
lines.push('little unsteady. Antony noticed it and gave him a reassuring smile.');
lines.push('"Ready?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('They sat down, and taking the bag between his knees, Antony pressed the');
lines.push('catch and opened it.');
lines.push('"Clothes!" said Bill.');
lines.push('Antony pulled out the top garment and shook it out. It was a wet brown');
lines.push('flannel coat.');
lines.push('"Do you recognize it?" he asked.');
lines.push('"Mark\'s brown flannel suit."');
lines.push('"The one he is advertised as having run away in?"');
lines.push('"Yes. It looks like it. Of course he had a dashed lot of clothes."');
lines.push('Antony put his hand in the breast-pocket and took out some letters. He');
lines.push('considered them doubtfully for a moment.');
lines.push('"I suppose I\'d better read them," he said. "I mean, just to see--" He');
lines.push('looked inquiringly at Bill, who nodded. Antony turned on his torch and');
lines.push('glanced at them. Bill waited anxiously.');
lines.push('"Yes. Mark.... Hallo!"');
lines.push('"What is it?"');
lines.push('"The letter that Cayley was telling the Inspector about. From Robert.');
lines.push('\'Mark, your loving brother is coming to see you--\' Yes, I suppose I had');
lines.push('better keep this. Well, that\'s his coat. Let\'s have out the rest of it."');
lines.push('He took the remaining clothes from the bag and spread them out.');
lines.push('"They\'re all here," said Bill. "Shirt, tie, socks, underclothes,');
lines.push('shoes--yes, all of them."');
lines.push('"All that he was wearing yesterday?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"What do you make of it?"');
lines.push('Bill shook his head, and asked another question.');
lines.push('"Is it what you expected?"');
lines.push('Antony laughed suddenly.');
lines.push('"It\'s too absurd," he said. "I expected--well, you know what I expected.');
lines.push('A body. A body in a suit of clothes. Well, perhaps it would be safer');
lines.push('to hide them separately. The body here, and the clothes in the passage,');
lines.push('where they would never betray themselves. And now he takes a great deal');
lines.push('of trouble to hide the clothes here, and doesn\'t bother about the body');
lines.push('at all." He shook his head. "I\'m a bit lost for the moment, Bill, and');
lines.push('that\'s the fact."');
lines.push('"Anything else there?"');
lines.push('Antony felt in the bag.');
lines.push('"Stones and--yes, there\'s something else." He took it out and held it');
lines.push('up. "There we are, Bill."');
lines.push('It was the office key.');
lines.push('"By Jove, you were right."');
lines.push('Antony felt in the bag again, and then turned it gently upside down on');
lines.push('the grass. A dozen large stones fell out--and something else. He flashed');
lines.push('down his torch.');
lines.push('"Another key," he said.');
lines.push('He put the two keys in his pocket, and sat there for a long time in');
lines.push('silence, thinking. Bill was silent, too, not liking to interrupt his');
lines.push('thoughts, but at last he said:');
lines.push('"Shall I put these things back?"');
lines.push('Antony looked up with a start.');
lines.push('"What? Oh, yes. No, I\'ll put them back. You give me a light, will you?"');
lines.push('Very slowly and carefully he put the clothes back in the bag, pausing as');
lines.push('he took up each garment, in the certainty, as it seemed to Bill, that');
lines.push('it had something to tell him if only he could read it. When the last of');
lines.push('them was inside, he still waited there on his knees, thinking.');
lines.push('"That\'s the lot," said Bill.');
lines.push('Antony nodded at him.');
lines.push('"Yes, that\'s the lot," he said; "and that\'s the funny thing about it.');
lines.push('You\'re sure it is the lot?"');
lines.push('"What do you mean?"');
lines.push('"Give me the torch a moment." He took it and flashed it over the ground');
lines.push('between them. "Yes, that\'s the lot. It\'s funny." He stood up, the bag in');
lines.push('his hands. "Now let\'s find a hiding-place for these, and then--" He said');
lines.push('no more, but stepped off through the trees, Bill following him meekly.');
lines.push('As soon as they had got the bag off their hands and were clear of the');
lines.push('copse, Antony became more communicative. He took the two keys out of his');
lines.push('pocket.');
lines.push('"One of them is the office key, I suppose, and the other is the key of');
lines.push('the passage cupboard. So I thought that perhaps we might have a look at');
lines.push('the cupboard."');
lines.push('"I say, do you really think it is?"');
lines.push('"Well, I don\'t see what else it can be."');
lines.push('"But why should he want to throw it away?"');
lines.push('"Because it has now done its work, whatever it was, and he wants to wash');
lines.push('his hands of the passage. He\'d throw the passage away if he could. I');
lines.push('don\'t think it matters much one way or another, and I don\'t suppose');
lines.push('there\'s anything to find in the cupboard, but I feel that we must look."');
lines.push('"Do you still think Mark\'s body might be there?"');
lines.push('"No. And yet where else can it be? Unless I\'m hopelessly wrong, and');
lines.push('Cayley never killed him at all."');
lines.push('Bill hesitated, wondering if he dare advance his theory.');
lines.push('"I know you\'ll think me an ass--"');
lines.push('"My dear Bill, I\'m such an obvious ass myself that I should be delighted');
lines.push('to think you are too."');
lines.push('"Well, then, suppose Mark did kill Robert, and Cayley helped him to');
lines.push('escape, just as we thought at first. I know you proved afterwards that');
lines.push('it was impossible, but suppose it happened in a way we don\'t know about');
lines.push('and for reasons we don\'t know about. I mean, there are such a lot of');
lines.push('funny things about the whole show that--well, almost anything might have');
lines.push('happened."');
lines.push('"You\'re quite right. Well?"');
lines.push('"Well, then, this clothes business. Doesn\'t that seem rather to bear out');
lines.push('the escaping theory? Mark\'s brown suit was known to the police. Couldn\'t');
lines.push('Cayley have brought him another one in the passage, to escape in, and');
lines.push('then have had the brown one on his hands? And thought it safest to hide');
lines.push('it in the pond?"');
lines.push('"Yes," said Anthony thoughtfully. Then: "Go on."');
lines.push('Bill went on eagerly:');
lines.push('"It all seems to fit in, you know. I mean even with your first');
lines.push('theory--that Mark killed him accidentally and then came to Cayley for');
lines.push('help. Of course, if Cayley had played fair, he\'d have told Mark that he');
lines.push('had nothing to be afraid of. But he isn\'t playing fair; he wants to get');
lines.push('Mark out of the way because of the girl. Well, this is his chance. He');
lines.push('makes Mark as frightened as possible, and tells him that his only hope');
lines.push('is to run away. Well, naturally, he does all he can to get him well');
lines.push('away, because if Mark is caught, the whole story of Cayley\'s treachery');
lines.push('comes out."');
lines.push('"Yes. But isn\'t it overdoing it rather to make him change his');
lines.push('underclothes and everything? It wastes a good deal of time, you know."');
lines.push('Bill was pulled up short, and said, "Oh!" in great disappointment.');
lines.push('"No, it\'s not as bad as that, Bill," said Antony with a smile. "I');
lines.push('daresay the underclothes could be explained. But here\'s the difficulty.');
lines.push('Why did Mark need to change from brown to blue, or whatever it was, when');
lines.push('Cayley was the only person who saw him in brown?"');
lines.push('"The police description of him says that he is in a brown suit."');
lines.push('"Yes, because Cayley told the police. You see, even if Mark had had');
lines.push('lunch in his brown suit, and the servants had noticed it, Cayley could');
lines.push('always have pretended that he had changed into blue after lunch, because');
lines.push('only Cayley saw him afterwards. So if Cayley had told the Inspector that');
lines.push('he was wearing blue, Mark could have escaped quite comfortably in his');
lines.push('brown, without needing to change at all."');
lines.push('"But that\'s just what he did do," cried Bill triumphantly. "What fools');
lines.push('we are!"');
lines.push('Antony looked at him in surprise, and then shook his head.');
lines.push('"Yes, yes!" insisted Bill. "Of course! Don\'t you see? Mark did change');
lines.push('after lunch, and, to give him more of a chance of getting away, Cayley');
lines.push('lied and said that he was wearing the brown suit in which the servants');
lines.push('had seen him. Well, then he was afraid that the police might examine');
lines.push('Mark\'s clothes and find the brown suit still there, so he hid it, and');
lines.push('then dropped it in the pond afterwards."');
lines.push('He turned eagerly to his friend, but Antony said nothing. Bill began to');
lines.push('speak again, and was promptly waved into silence.');
lines.push('"Don\'t say anything more, old boy; you\'ve given me quite enough to think');
lines.push('about. Don\'t let\'s bother about it to-night. We\'ll just have a look at');
lines.push('this cupboard and then get to bed."');
lines.push('But the cupboard had not much to tell them that night. It was empty save');
lines.push('for a few old bottles.');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s that," said Bill.');
lines.push('But Antony, on his knees with the torch in his hand, continued to search');
lines.push('for something.');
lines.push('"What are you looking for?" asked Bill at last.');
lines.push('"Something that isn\'t there," said Antony, getting up and dusting his');
lines.push('trousers. And he locked the door again.');
lines.push('CHAPTER XVIII. Guess-work');
lines.push('The inquest was at three o\'clock; thereafter Antony could have no claim');
lines.push('on the hospitality of the Red House. By ten o\'clock his bag was packed,');
lines.push('and waiting to be taken to \'The George.\' To Bill, coming upstairs after');
lines.push('a more prolonged breakfast, this early morning bustle was a little');
lines.push('surprising.');
lines.push('"What\'s the hurry?" he asked.');
lines.push('"None. But we don\'t want to come back here after the inquest. Get your');
lines.push('packing over now and then we can have the morning to ourselves."');
lines.push('"Righto." He turned to go to his room, and then came back again. "I say,');
lines.push('are we going to tell Cayley that we\'re staying at \'The George\'?"');
lines.push('"You\'re not staying at \'The George,\' Bill. Not officially. You\'re going');
lines.push('back to London."');
lines.push('"Oh!"');
lines.push('"Yes. Ask Cayley to have your luggage sent in to Stanton, ready for you');
lines.push('when you catch a train there after the inquest. You can tell him that');
lines.push('you\'ve got to see the Bishop of London at once. The fact that you are');
lines.push('hurrying back to London to be confirmed will make it seem more natural');
lines.push('that I should resume my interrupted solitude at \'The George\' as soon as');
lines.push('you have gone."');
lines.push('"Then where do I sleep to-night?"');
lines.push('"Officially, I suppose, in Fulham Place; unofficially, I suspect, in');
lines.push('my bed, unless they\'ve got another spare room at \'The George.\' I\'ve put');
lines.push('your confirmation robe--I mean your pyjamas and brushes and things--in');
lines.push('my bag, ready for you. Is there anything else you want to know? No? Then');
lines.push('go and pack. And meet me at ten-thirty beneath the blasted oak or in the');
lines.push('hall or somewhere. I want to talk and talk and talk, and I must have my');
lines.push('Watson."');
lines.push('"Good," said Bill, and went off to his room.');
lines.push('An hour later, having communicated their official plans to Cayley, they');
lines.push('wandered out together into the park.');
lines.push('"Well?" said Bill, as they sat down underneath a convenient tree. "Talk');
lines.push('away."');
lines.push('"I had many bright thoughts in my bath this morning," began Antony. "The');
lines.push('brightest one of all was that we were being damn fools, and working at');
lines.push('this thing from the wrong end altogether."');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s helpful."');
lines.push('"Of course it\'s very hampering being a detective, when you don\'t know');
lines.push('anything about detecting, and when nobody knows that you\'re doing');
lines.push('detection, and you can\'t have people up to cross-examine them, and you');
lines.push('have neither the energy nor the means to make proper inquiries; and,');
lines.push('in short, when you\'re doing the whole thing in a thoroughly amateur,');
lines.push('haphazard way."');
lines.push('"For amateurs I don\'t think we\'re doing at all badly," protested Bill.');
lines.push('"No; not for amateurs. But if we had been professionals, I believe we');
lines.push('should have gone at it from the other end. The Robert end. We\'ve been');
lines.push('wondering about Mark and Cayley all the time. Now let\'s wonder about');
lines.push('Robert for a bit."');
lines.push('"We know so little about him."');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s see what we do know. First of all, then, we know vaguely');
lines.push('that he was a bad lot--the sort of brother who is hushed up in front of');
lines.push('other people."');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"We know that he announced his approaching arrival to Mark in a rather');
lines.push('unpleasant letter, which I have in my pocket."');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"And then we know rather a curious thing. We know that Mark told you all');
lines.push('that this black sheep was coming. Now, why did he tell you?"');
lines.push('Bill was thoughtful for a moment.');
lines.push('"I suppose," he said slowly, "that he knew we were bound to see him, and');
lines.push('thought that the best way was to be quite frank about him."');
lines.push('"But were you bound to see him? You were all away playing golf."');
lines.push('"We were bound to see him if he stayed in the house that night."');
lines.push('"Very well, then. That\'s one thing we\'ve discovered. Mark knew that');
lines.push('Robert was staying in the house that night. Or shall we put it this');
lines.push('way--he knew that there was no chance of getting Robert out of the house');
lines.push('at once."');
lines.push('Bill looked at his friend eagerly.');
lines.push('"Go on," he said. "This is getting interesting."');
lines.push('"He also knew something else," went on Antony. "He knew that Robert was');
lines.push('bound to betray his real character to you as soon as you met him.');
lines.push('He couldn\'t pass him off on you as just a travelled brother from the');
lines.push('Dominions, with perhaps a bit of an accent; he had to tell you at once,');
lines.push('because you were bound to find out, that Robert was a wastrel."');
lines.push('"Yes. That\'s sound enough."');
lines.push('"Well, now, doesn\'t it strike you that Mark made up his mind about all');
lines.push('that rather quickly?"');
lines.push('"How do you mean?"');
lines.push('"He got this letter at breakfast. He read it; and directly he had read');
lines.push('it he began to confide in you all. That is to say, in about one second');
lines.push('he thought out the whole business and came to a decision--to two');
lines.push('decisions. He considered the possibility of getting Robert out of');
lines.push('the way before you came back, and decided that it was impossible. He');
lines.push('considered the possibility of Robert\'s behaving like an ordinary decent');
lines.push('person in public, and decided that it was very unlikely. He came to');
lines.push('those two decisions instantaneously, as he was reading the letter. Isn\'t');
lines.push('that rather quick work?"');
lines.push('"Well, what\'s the explanation?"');
lines.push('Antony waited until he had refilled and lighted his pipe before');
lines.push('answering.');
lines.push('"What\'s the explanation? Well, let\'s leave it for a moment and take');
lines.push('another look at the two brothers. In conjunction, this time, with Mrs.');
lines.push('Norbury."');
lines.push('"Mrs. Norbury?" said Bill, surprised.');
lines.push('"Yes. Mark hoped to marry Miss Norbury. Now, if Robert really was a blot');
lines.push('upon the family honour, Mark would want to do one of two things. Either');
lines.push('keep it from the Norburys altogether, or else, if it had to come out,');
lines.push('tell them himself before the news came to them indirectly. Well, he told');
lines.push('them. But the funny thing is that he told them the day before');
lines.push('Robert\'s letter came. Robert came, and was killed, the day before');
lines.push('yesterday--Tuesday. Mark told Mrs. Norbury about him on Monday. What do');
lines.push('you make of that?"');
lines.push('"Coincidence," said Bill, after careful thought. "He\'d always meant');
lines.push('to tell her; his suit was prospering, and just before it was finally');
lines.push('settled, he told her. That happened to be Monday. On Tuesday he got');
lines.push('Robert\'s letter, and felt jolly glad that he\'d told her in time."');
lines.push('"Well, it might be that, but it\'s rather a curious coincidence. And here');
lines.push('is something which makes it very curious indeed. It only occurred to');
lines.push('me in the bath this morning. Inspiring place, a bathroom. Well, it\'s');
lines.push('this--he told her on Monday morning, on his way to Middleston in the');
lines.push('car."');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"Well."');
lines.push('"Sorry, Tony; I\'m dense this morning."');
lines.push('"In the car, Bill. And how near can the car get to Jallands?"');
lines.push('"About six hundred yards."');
lines.push('"Yes. And on his way to Middleston, on some business or other, Mark');
lines.push('stops the car, walks six hundred yards down the hill to Jallands, says,');
lines.push('\'Oh, by the way, Mrs. Norbury, I don\'t think I ever told you that I');
lines.push('have a shady brother called Robert,\' walks six hundred yards up the hill');
lines.push('again, gets into the car, and goes off to Middleston. Is that likely?"');
lines.push('Bill frowned heavily.');
lines.push('"Yes, but I don\'t see what you\'re getting at. Likely or not likely, we');
lines.push('know he did do it."');
lines.push('"Of course he did. All I mean is that he must have had some strong');
lines.push('reason for telling Mrs. Norbury at once. And the reason I suggest is');
lines.push('that he knew on that morning--Monday morning, not Tuesday--that Robert');
lines.push('was coming to see him, and had to be in first with the news.');
lines.push('"But--but--"');
lines.push('"And that would explain the other point--his instantaneous decision at');
lines.push('breakfast to tell you all about his brother. It wasn\'t instantaneous. He');
lines.push('knew on Monday that Robert was coming, and decided then that you would');
lines.push('all have to know."');
lines.push('"Then how do you explain the letter?"');
lines.push('"Well, let\'s have a look at it."');
lines.push('Antony took the letter from his pocket and spread it out on the grass');
lines.push('between them.');
lines.push('"Mark, your loving brother is coming to see you to-morrow, all the way');
lines.push('from Australia. I give you warning, so that you will be able to conceal');
lines.push('your surprise but not I hope your pleasure. Expect him at three or');
lines.push('thereabouts."');
lines.push('"No date mentioned, you see," said Antony. "Just to-morrow."');
lines.push('"But he got this on Tuesday."');
lines.push('"Did he?"');
lines.push('"Well, he read it out to us on Tuesday."');
lines.push('"Oh, yes! he read it out to you."');
lines.push('Bill read the letter again, and then turned it over and looked at the');
lines.push('back of it. The back of it had nothing to say to him.');
lines.push('"What about the postmark?" he asked.');
lines.push('"We haven\'t got the envelope, unfortunately."');
lines.push('"And you think that he got this letter on Monday."');
lines.push('"I\'m inclined to think so, Bill. Anyhow, I think--I feel almost');
lines.push('certain--that he knew on Monday that his brother was coming."');
lines.push('"Is that going to help us much?"');
lines.push('"No. It makes it more difficult. There\'s something rather uncanny about');
lines.push('it all. I don\'t understand it." He was silent for a little, and then');
lines.push('added, "I wonder if the inquest is going to help us.');
lines.push('"What about last night? I\'m longing to hear what you make of that. Have');
lines.push('you been thinking it out at all?"');
lines.push('"Last night," said Antony thoughtfully to himself. "Yes, last night');
lines.push('wants some explaining."');
lines.push('Bill waited hopefully for him to explain. What, for instance, had Antony');
lines.push('been looking for in the cupboard?');
lines.push('"I think," began Antony slowly, "that after last night we must give up');
lines.push('the idea that Mark has been killed; killed, I mean, by Cayley. I don\'t');
lines.push('believe anybody would go to so much trouble to hide a suit of clothes');
lines.push('when he had a body on his hands. The body would seem so much more');
lines.push('important. I think we may take it now that the clothes are all that');
lines.push('Cayley had to hide."');
lines.push('"But why not have kept them in the passage?"');
lines.push('"He was frightened of the passage. Miss Norris knew about it."');
lines.push('"Well, then, in his own bedroom, or even, in Mark\'s. For all you or I');
lines.push('or anybody knew, Mark might have had two brown suits. He probably had, I');
lines.push('should think."');
lines.push('"Probably. But I doubt if that would reassure Cayley. The brown suit');
lines.push('hid a secret, and therefore the brown suit had to be hidden. We all');
lines.push('know that in theory the safest hiding-place is the most obvious, but in');
lines.push('practice very few people have the nerve to risk it."');
lines.push('Bill looked rather disappointed.');
lines.push('"Then we just come back to where we were," he complained. "Mark killed');
lines.push('his brother, and Cayley helped him to escape through the passage; either');
lines.push('in order to compromise him, or because there was no other way out of it.');
lines.push('And he helped him by telling a lie about his brown suit."');
lines.push('Antony smiled at him in genuine amusement.');
lines.push('"Bad luck, Bill," he said sympathetically. "There\'s only one murder,');
lines.push('after all. I\'m awfully sorry about it. It was my fault for--"');
lines.push('"Shut up, you ass. You know I didn\'t mean that."');
lines.push('"Well, you seemed awfully disappointed."');
lines.push('Bill said nothing for a little, and then with a sudden laugh confessed.');
lines.push('"It was so exciting yesterday," he said apologetically, "and we seemed');
lines.push('to be just getting there, and discovering the most wonderful things, and');
lines.push('now--"');
lines.push('"And now?"');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s so much more ordinary."');
lines.push('Antony gave a shout of laughter.');
lines.push('"Ordinary!" he cried. "Ordinary! Well, I\'m dashed! Ordinary! If only');
lines.push('one thing would happen in an ordinary way, we might do something, but');
lines.push('everything is ridiculous." Bill brightened up again.');
lines.push('"Ridiculous? How?"');
lines.push('"Every way. Take those ridiculous clothes we found last night. You can');
lines.push('explain the brown suit, but why the under clothes. You can explain the');
lines.push('underclothes in some absurd way, if you like--you can say that Mark');
lines.push('always changed his underclothes whenever he interviewed anybody from');
lines.push('Australia--but why, in that case, my dear Watson, why didn\'t he change');
lines.push('his collar?"');
lines.push('"His collar?" said Bill in amazement.');
lines.push('"His collar, Watson."');
lines.push('"I don\'t understand."');
lines.push('"And it\'s all so ordinary," scoffed Antony.');
lines.push('"Sorry, Tony, I didn\'t mean that. Tell me about the collar."');
lines.push('"Well, that\'s all. There was no collar in the bag last night. Shirt,');
lines.push('socks, tie--everything except a collar. Why?"');
lines.push('"Was that what you were looking for in the cupboard?" said Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('"Of course. \'Why no collar?\' I said. For some reason Cayley considered');
lines.push('it necessary to hide all Mark\'s clothes; not just the suit, but');
lines.push('everything which he was wearing, or supposed to be wearing, at the time');
lines.push('of the murder. But he hadn\'t hidden the collar. Why? Had he left it out');
lines.push('by mistake? So I looked in the cupboard. It wasn\'t there. Had he left it');
lines.push('out on purpose? If so, why?--and where was it? Naturally I began to say');
lines.push('to myself, \'Where have I seen a collar lately? A collar all by itself?\'');
lines.push('And I remembered--what, Bill?"');
lines.push('Bill frowned heavily to himself, and shook his head.');
lines.push('"Don\'t ask me, Tony. I can\'t--By Jove!" He threw up his head, "In the');
lines.push('basket in the office bedroom!"');
lines.push('"Exactly."');
lines.push('"But is that the one?"');
lines.push('"The one that goes with the rest of the clothes? I don\'t know. Where');
lines.push('else can it be? But if so, why send the collar quite casually to the');
lines.push('wash in the ordinary way, and take immense trouble to hide everything');
lines.push('else? Why, why, why?"');
lines.push('Bill bit hard at his pipe, but could think of nothing to say.');
lines.push('"Anyhow," said Antony, getting up restlessly, "I\'m certain of one thing.');
lines.push('Mark knew on the Monday that Robert was coming here."');
lines.push('CHAPTER XIX. The Inquest');
lines.push('The Coroner, having made a few commonplace remarks as to the terrible');
lines.push('nature of the tragedy which they had come to investigate that afternoon,');
lines.push('proceeded to outline the case to the jury. Witnesses would be called to');
lines.push('identify the deceased as Robert Ablett, the brother of the owner of the');
lines.push('Red House, Mark Ablett. It would be shown that he was something of a');
lines.push('ne\'er-do-well, who had spent most of his life in Australia, and that he');
lines.push('had announced, in what might almost be called a threatening letter,');
lines.push('his intention of visiting his brother that afternoon. There would');
lines.push('be evidence of his arrival, of his being shown into the scene of the');
lines.push('tragedy--a room in the Red House, commonly called "the office"--and of');
lines.push('his brother\'s entrance into that room. The jury would have to form their');
lines.push('own opinion as to what happened there. But whatever happened, happened');
lines.push('almost instantaneously. Within two minutes of Mark Ablett\'s entrance, as');
lines.push('would be shown in the evidence, a shot was heard, and when--perhaps five');
lines.push('minutes later--the room was forced open, the dead body of Robert Ablett');
lines.push('was found stretched upon the floor. As regards Mark Ablett, nobody had');
lines.push('seen him from the moment of his going into the room, but evidence would');
lines.push('be called to show that he had enough money on him at the time to take');
lines.push('him to any other part of the country, and that a man answering to');
lines.push('his description had been observed on the platform of Stanton station,');
lines.push('apparently waiting to catch the 3.55 up train to London. As the jury');
lines.push('would realize, such evidence of identity was not always reliable.');
lines.push('Missing men had a way of being seen in a dozen different places at once.');
lines.push('In any case, there was no doubt that for the moment Mark Ablett had');
lines.push('disappeared.');
lines.push('"Seems a sound man," whispered Antony to Bill. "Doesn\'t talk too much."');
lines.push('Antony did not expect to learn much from the evidence--he knew the');
lines.push('facts of the case so well by now--but he wondered if Inspector Birch had');
lines.push('developed any new theories. If so, they would appear in the Coroner\'s');
lines.push('examination, for the Coroner would certainly have been coached by the');
lines.push('police as to the important facts to be extracted from each witness. Bill');
lines.push('was the first to be put through it.');
lines.push('"Now, about this letter, Mr. Beverley?" he was asked when his chief');
lines.push('evidence was over. "Did you see it at all?"');
lines.push('"I didn\'t see the actual writing. I saw the back of it. Mark was holding');
lines.push('it up when he told us about his brother."');
lines.push('"You don\'t know what was in it, then?"');
lines.push('Bill had a sudden shock. He had read the letter only that morning. He');
lines.push('knew quite well what was in it. But it wouldn\'t do to admit this. And');
lines.push('then, just as he was about to perjure himself, he remembered: Antony had');
lines.push('heard Cayley telling the Inspector.');
lines.push('"I knew afterwards. I was told. But Mark didn\'t read it out at');
lines.push('breakfast."');
lines.push('"You gathered, however, that it was an unwelcome letter?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes!"');
lines.push('"Would you say that Mark was frightened by it?"');
lines.push('"Not frightened. Sort of bitter--and resigned. Sort of \'Oh, Lord, here');
lines.push('we are again!\'"');
lines.push('There was a titter here and there. The Coroner smiled, and tried to');
lines.push('pretend that he hadn\'t.');
lines.push('"Thank you, Mr. Beverley."');
lines.push('The next witness was summoned by the name of Andrew Amos, and Antony');
lines.push('looked up with interest, wondering who he was.');
lines.push('"He lives at the inner lodge," whispered Bill to him.');
lines.push('All that Amos had to say was that a stranger had passed by his lodge at');
lines.push('a little before three that afternoon, and had spoken to him. He had seen');
lines.push('the body and recognized it as the man.');
lines.push('"What did he say?"');
lines.push('"\'Is this right for the Red House?\' or something like that, sir."');
lines.push('"What did you say?"');
lines.push('"I said, \'This is the Red House. Who do you want to see?\' He was a');
lines.push('bit rough-looking, you know, sir, and I didn\'t know what he was doing');
lines.push('there."');
lines.push('"Well?"');
lines.push('"Well, sir, he said, \'Is Mister Mark Ablett at home?\' It doesn\'t sound');
lines.push('much put like that, sir, but I didn\'t care about the way he said it.');
lines.push('So I got in front of him like, and said, \'What do you want, eh?\' and he');
lines.push('gave a sort of chuckle and said, \'I want to see my dear brother Mark.\'');
lines.push('Well, then I took a closer look at him, and I see that p\'raps he might');
lines.push('be his brother, so I said, \'If you\'ll follow the drive, sir, you\'ll come');
lines.push('to the house. Of course I can\'t say if Mr. Ablett\'s at home.\' And he');
lines.push('gave a sort of nasty laugh again, and said, \'Fine place Mister Mark');
lines.push('Ablett\'s got here. Plenty of money to spend, eh?\' Well, then I had');
lines.push('another look at him, sir, because gentlemen don\'t talk like that, and');
lines.push('if he was Mr. Ablett\'s brother--but before I could make up my mind, he');
lines.push('laughed and went on. That\'s all I can tell you, sir."');
lines.push('Andrew Amos stepped down and moved away to the back of the room, nor did');
lines.push('Antony take his eyes off him until he was assured that Amos intended to');
lines.push('remain there until the inquest was over.');
lines.push('"Who\'s Amos talking to now?" he whispered to Bill.');
lines.push('"Parsons. One of the gardeners. He\'s at the outside lodge on the Stanton');
lines.push('road. They\'re all here to-day. Sort of holiday for \'em.');
lines.push('"I wonder if he\'s giving evidence too," thought Antony. He was. He');
lines.push('followed Amos. He had been at work on the lawn in front of the house,');
lines.push('and had seen Robert Ablett arrive. He didn\'t hear the shot--not to');
lines.push('notice. He was a little hard of hearing. He had seen a gentleman arrive');
lines.push('about five minutes after Mr. Robert.');
lines.push('"Can you see him in court now?" asked the Coroner. Parsons looked round');
lines.push('slowly. Antony caught his eye and smiled.');
lines.push('"That\'s him," said Parsons, pointing.');
lines.push('Everybody looked at Antony.');
lines.push('"That was about five minutes afterwards?"');
lines.push('"About that, sir."');
lines.push('"Did anybody come out of the house before this gentleman\'s arrival?"');
lines.push('"No, sir. That is to say I didn\'t see \'em."');
lines.push('Stevens followed. She gave her evidence much as she had given it to the');
lines.push('Inspector. Nothing new was brought out by her examination. Then came');
lines.push('Elsie. As the reporters scribbled down what she had overheard, they');
lines.push('added in brackets "Sensation" for the first time that afternoon.');
lines.push('"How soon after you had heard this did the shot come?" asked the');
lines.push('Coroner.');
lines.push('"Almost at once, sir."');
lines.push('"A minute?"');
lines.push('"I couldn\'t really say, sir. It was so quick."');
lines.push('"Were you still in the hall?"');
lines.push('"Oh, no, sir. I was just outside Mrs. Stevens\' room. The housekeeper,');
lines.push('sir."');
lines.push('"You didn\'t think of going back to the hall to see what had happened?"');
lines.push('"Oh, no, sir. I just went in to Mrs. Stevens, and she said, \'Oh, what');
lines.push('was that?\' frightened-like. And I said, \'That was in the house, Mrs.');
lines.push('Stevens, that was.\' Just like something going off, it was."');
lines.push('"Thank you," said the Coroner.');
lines.push('There was another emotional disturbance in the room as Cayley went into');
lines.push('the witness-box; not "Sensation" this time, but an eager and, as it');
lines.push('seemed to Antony, sympathetic interest. Now they were getting to grips');
lines.push('with the drama.');
lines.push('He gave his evidence carefully, unemotionally--the lies with the same');
lines.push('slow deliberation as the truth. Antony watched him intently, wondering');
lines.push('what it was about him which had this odd sort of attractiveness. For');
lines.push('Antony, who knew that he was lying, and lying (as he believed) not for');
lines.push('Mark\'s sake but his own, yet could not help sharing some of that general');
lines.push('sympathy with him.');
lines.push('"Was Mark ever in possession of a revolver?" asked the Coroner.');
lines.push('"Not to my knowledge. I think I should have known if he had been."');
lines.push('"You were alone with him all that morning. Did he talk about this visit');
lines.push('of Robert\'s at all?"');
lines.push('"I didn\'t see very much of him in the morning. I was at work in my room,');
lines.push('and outside, and so on. We lunched together and he talked of it then a');
lines.push('little."');
lines.push('"In what terms?"');
lines.push('"Well--" he hesitated, and then went on. "I can\'t think of a better word');
lines.push('than \'peevishly.\' Occasionally he said, \'What do you think he wants?\' or');
lines.push('\'Why couldn\'t he have stayed where he was?\' or \'I don\'t like the tone');
lines.push('of his letter. Do you think he means trouble?\' He talked rather in that');
lines.push('kind of way."');
lines.push('"Did he express his surprise that his brother should be in England?"');
lines.push('"I think he was always afraid that he would turn up one day."');
lines.push('"Yes.... You didn\'t hear any conversation between the brothers when they');
lines.push('were in the office together?"');
lines.push('"No. I happened to go into the library just after Mark had gone in, and');
lines.push('I was there all the time."');
lines.push('"Was the library door open?"');
lines.push('"Oh, yes."');
lines.push('"Did you see or hear the last witness at all?"');
lines.push('"No."');
lines.push('"If anybody had come out of the office while you were in the library,');
lines.push('would you have heard it?"');
lines.push('"I think so. Unless they had come out very quietly on purpose."');
lines.push('"Would you call Mark a hasty-tempered man?"');
lines.push('Cayley considered this carefully before answering.');
lines.push('"Hasty-tempered, yes," he said. "But not violent-tempered."');
lines.push('"Was he fairly athletic? Active and quick?"');
lines.push('"Active and quick, yes. Not particularly strong."');
lines.push('"Yes.... One question more. Was Mark in the habit of carrying any');
lines.push('considerable sum of money about with him?"');
lines.push('"Yes. He always had one 100 pound note on him, and perhaps ten or twenty');
lines.push('pounds as well."');
lines.push('"Thank you, Mr. Cayley."');
lines.push('Cayley went back heavily to his seat. "Damn it," said Antony to himself,');
lines.push('"why do I like the fellow?"');
lines.push('"Antony Gillingham!"');
lines.push('Again the eager interest of the room could be felt. Who was this');
lines.push('stranger who had got mixed up in the business so mysteriously?');
lines.push('Antony smiled at Bill and stepped up to give his evidence.');
lines.push('He explained how he came to be staying at \'The George\' at Waldheim, how');
lines.push('he had heard that the Red House was in the neighbourhood, how he had');
lines.push('walked over to see his friend Beverley, and had arrived just after the');
lines.push('tragedy. Thinking it over afterwards he was fairly certain that he had');
lines.push('heard the shot, but it had not made any impression on him at the time.');
lines.push('He had come to the house from the Waldheim end and consequently had seen');
lines.push('nothing of Robert Ablett, who had been a few minutes in front of him.');
lines.push('From this point his evidence coincided with Cayley\'s.');
lines.push('"You and the last witness reached the French windows together and found');
lines.push('them shut?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"You pushed them in and came to the body. Of course you had no idea');
lines.push('whose body it was?"');
lines.push('"No."');
lines.push('"Did Mr. Cayley say anything?"');
lines.push('"He turned the body over, just so as to see the face, and when he saw');
lines.push('it, he said, \'Thank God.\'"');
lines.push('Again the reporters wrote "Sensation."');
lines.push('"Did you understand what he meant by that?"');
lines.push('"I asked him who it was, and he said that it was Robert Ablett. Then');
lines.push('he explained that he was afraid at first it was the cousin with whom he');
lines.push('lived--Mark."');
lines.push('"Yes. Did he seem upset?"');
lines.push('"Very much so at first. Less when he found that it wasn\'t Mark."');
lines.push('There was a sudden snigger from a nervous gentleman in the crowd at the');
lines.push('back of the room, and the Coroner put on his glasses and stared sternly');
lines.push('in the direction from which it came. The nervous gentleman hastily');
lines.push('decided that the time had come to do up his bootlace. The Coroner put');
lines.push('down his glasses and continued.');
lines.push('"Did anybody come out of the house while you were coming up the drive?"');
lines.push('"No."');
lines.push('"Thank you, Mr. Gillingham."');
lines.push('He was followed by Inspector Birch. The Inspector, realizing that');
lines.push('this was his afternoon, and that the eyes of the world were upon');
lines.push('him, produced a plan of the house and explained the situation of the');
lines.push('different rooms. The plan was then handed to the jury.');
lines.push('Inspector Birch, so he told the world, had arrived at the Red House');
lines.push('at 4.42 p.m. on the afternoon in question. He had been received by Mr.');
lines.push('Matthew Cayley, who had made a short statement to him, and he had then');
lines.push('proceeded to examine the scene of the crime. The French windows had been');
lines.push('forced from outside. The door leading into the hall was locked; he had');
lines.push('searched the room thoroughly and had found no trace of a key. In the');
lines.push('bedroom leading out of the office he had found an open window. There');
lines.push('were no marks on the window, but it was a low one, and, as he found');
lines.push('from experiment, quite easy to step out of without touching it with the');
lines.push('boots. A few yards outside the window a shrubbery began. There were no');
lines.push('recent footmarks outside the window, but the ground was in a very hard');
lines.push('condition owing to the absence of rain. In the shrubbery, however, he');
lines.push('found several twigs on the ground, recently broken off, together with');
lines.push('other evidence that some body had been forcing its way through. He had');
lines.push('questioned everybody connected with the estate, and none of them had');
lines.push('been into the shrubbery recently. By forcing a way through the shrubbery');
lines.push('it was possible for a person to make a detour of the house and get to');
lines.push('the Stanton end of the park without ever being in sight of the house');
lines.push('itself.');
lines.push('He had made inquiries about the deceased. Deceased had left for');
lines.push('Australia some fifteen years ago, owing to some financial trouble at');
lines.push('home. Deceased was not well spoken of in the village from which he and');
lines.push('his brother had come. Deceased and his brother had never been on good');
lines.push('terms, and the fact that Mark Ablett had come into money had been a');
lines.push('cause of great bitterness between them. It was shortly after this that');
lines.push('Robert had left for Australia.');
lines.push('He had made inquiries at Stanton station. It had been market-day at');
lines.push('Stanton and the station had been more full of arrivals than usual.');
lines.push('Nobody had particularly noticed the arrival of Robert Ablett; there had');
lines.push('been a good many passengers by the 2.10 train that afternoon, the train');
lines.push('by which Robert had undoubtedly come from London. A witness, however,');
lines.push('would state that he noticed a man resembling Mark Ablett at the station');
lines.push('at 3.53 p.m. that afternoon, and this man caught the 3.55 up train to');
lines.push('town.');
lines.push('There was a pond in the grounds of the Red House. He had dragged this,');
lines.push('but without result....');
lines.push('Antony listened to him carelessly, thinking his own thoughts all the');
lines.push('time. Medical evidence followed, but there was nothing to be got from');
lines.push('that. He felt so close to the truth; at any moment something might give');
lines.push('his brain the one little hint which it wanted. Inspector Birch was just');
lines.push('pursuing the ordinary. Whatever else this case was, it was not ordinary.');
lines.push('There was something uncanny about it.');
lines.push('John Borden was giving evidence. He was on the up platform seeing a');
lines.push('friend off by the 3.55 on Tuesday afternoon. He had noticed a man on the');
lines.push('platform with coat collar turned up and a scarf round his chin. He had');
lines.push('wondered why the man should do this on such a hot day. The man seemed to');
lines.push('be trying to escape observation. Directly the train came in, he hurried');
lines.push('into a carriage. And so on.');
lines.push('"There\'s always a John Borden at every murder case," said Antony to');
lines.push('himself.');
lines.push('"Have you ever seen Mark Ablett?"');
lines.push('"Once or twice, sir."');
lines.push('"Was it he?"');
lines.push('"I never really got a good look at him, sir, what with his collar turned');
lines.push('up and the scarf and all. But directly I heard of the sad affair, and');
lines.push('that Mr. Ablett was missing, I said to Mrs. Borden, \'Now I wonder if');
lines.push('that was Mr. Ablett I saw at the station?\' So then we talked it over and');
lines.push('decided that I ought to come and tell Inspector Birch. It was just Mr.');
lines.push('Ablett\'s height, sir."');
lines.push('Antony went on with his thoughts....');
lines.push('The Coroner was summing up. The jury, he said, had now heard all the');
lines.push('evidence and would have to decide what had happened in that room between');
lines.push('the two brothers. How had the deceased met his death? The medical');
lines.push('evidence would probably satisfy them that Robert Ablett had died from');
lines.push('the effects of a bullet-wound in the head. Who had fired that bullet?');
lines.push('If Robert Ablett had fired it himself, no doubt they would bring in');
lines.push('a verdict of suicide, but if this had been so, where was the revolver');
lines.push('which had fired it, and what had become of Mark Ablett? If they');
lines.push('disbelieved in this possibility of suicide, what remained? Accidental');
lines.push('death, justifiable homicide, and murder. Could the deceased have been');
lines.push('killed accidentally? It was possible, but then would Mark Ablett have');
lines.push('run away? The evidence that he had run away from the scene of the crime');
lines.push('was strong. His cousin had seen him go into the room, the servant Elsie');
lines.push('Wood had heard him quarrelling with his brother in the room, the door');
lines.push('had been locked from the inside, and there were signs that outside');
lines.push('the open window some one had pushed his way very recently through the');
lines.push('shrubbery. Who, if not Mark? They would have then to consider whether he');
lines.push('would have run away if he had been guiltless of his brother\'s death. No');
lines.push('doubt innocent people lost their heads sometimes. It was possible that');
lines.push('if it were proved afterwards that Mark Ablett had shot his brother, it');
lines.push('might also be proved that he was justified in so doing, and that when he');
lines.push('ran away from his brother\'s corpse he had really nothing to fear at the');
lines.push('hands of the Law. In this connection he need hardly remind the jury that');
lines.push('they were not the final tribunal, and that if they found Mark Ablett');
lines.push('guilty of murder it would not prejudice his trial in any way if and when');
lines.push('he was apprehended.... The jury could consider their verdict.');
lines.push('They considered it. They announced that the deceased had died as the');
lines.push('result of a bullet-wound, and that the bullet had been fired by his');
lines.push('brother Mark Ablett.');
lines.push('Bill turned round to Antony at his side. But Antony was gone. Across the');
lines.push('room he saw Andrew Amos and Parsons going out of the door together, and');
lines.push('Antony was between them.');
lines.push('CHAPTER XX. Mr. Beverley is Tactful');
lines.push('The inquest had been held at the "Lamb" at Stanton; at Stanton Robert');
lines.push('Ablett was to be buried next day. Bill waited about outside for his');
lines.push('friend, wondering where he had gone. Then, realizing that Cayley would');
lines.push('be coming out to his car directly, and that a farewell talk with Cayley');
lines.push('would be a little embarrassing, he wandered round to the yard at');
lines.push('the back of the inn, lit a cigarette, and stood surveying a torn and');
lines.push('weather-beaten poster on the stable wall. "GRAND THEATRICAL ENTER" it');
lines.push('announced, to take place on "Wednesday, Decem." Bill smiled to himself');
lines.push('as he looked at it, for the part of Joe, a loquacious postman, had');
lines.push('been played by "William B. Beverl," as the remnants of the poster still');
lines.push('maintained, and he had been much less loquacious than the author had');
lines.push('intended, having forgotten his words completely, but it had all been');
lines.push('great fun. And then he stopped smiling, for there would be no more fun');
lines.push('now at the Red House.');
lines.push('"Sorry to keep you waiting," said the voice of Antony behind him. "My');
lines.push('old friends Amos and Parsons insisted on giving me a drink."');
lines.push('He slipped his hand into the crook of Bill\'s arm, and smiled happily at');
lines.push('him.');
lines.push('"Why were you so keen about them?" asked Bill a little resentfully. "I');
lines.push('couldn\'t think where on earth you had got to."');
lines.push('Antony didn\'t say anything. He was staring at the poster.');
lines.push('"When did this happen?" he asked.');
lines.push('"What?"');
lines.push('Antony waved to the poster.');
lines.push('"Oh, that? Last Christmas. It was rather fun."');
lines.push('Antony began to laugh to himself.');
lines.push('"Were you good?"');
lines.push('"Rotten. I don\'t profess to be an actor."');
lines.push('"Mark good?"');
lines.push('"Oh, rather. He loves it."');
lines.push('"Rev. Henry Stutters--Mr. Matthew Cay," read Antony.');
lines.push('"Was that our friend Cayley?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"Any good?"');
lines.push('"Well, much better than I expected. He wasn\'t keen, but Mark made him."');
lines.push('"Miss Norris wasn\'t playing, I see."');
lines.push('"My dear Tony, she\'s a professional. Of course she wasn\'t."');
lines.push('Antony laughed again.');
lines.push('"A great success, was it?"');
lines.push('"Oh, rather!"');
lines.push('"I\'m a fool, and a damned fool," Antony announced solemnly. "And a');
lines.push('damned fool," he said again under his breath, as he led Bill away from');
lines.push('the poster, and out of the yard into the road. "And a damned fool. Even');
lines.push('now--" He broke off and then asked suddenly, "Did Mark ever have much');
lines.push('trouble with his teeth?"');
lines.push('"He went to his dentist a good deal. But what on earth--"');
lines.push('Antony laughed a third time.');
lines.push('"What luck!" he chuckled. "But how do you know?"');
lines.push('"We go to the same man; Mark recommended him to me. Cartwright, in');
lines.push('Wimpole Street."');
lines.push('"Cartwright in Wimpole Street," repeated Antony thoughtfully. "Yes, I');
lines.push('can remember that. Cartwright in Wimpole Street. Did Cayley go to him');
lines.push('too, by any chance?"');
lines.push('"I expect so. Oh, yes, I know he did. But what on earth--"');
lines.push('"What was Mark\'s general health like? Did he see a doctor much?"');
lines.push('"Hardly at all, I should think. He did a lot of early morning exercises');
lines.push('which were supposed to make him bright and cheerful at breakfast. They');
lines.push('didn\'t do that, but they seemed to keep him pretty fit. Tony, I wish');
lines.push('you\'d--"');
lines.push('Antony held up a hand and hushed him into silence.');
lines.push('"One last question," he said. "Was Mark fond of swimming?"');
lines.push('"No, he hated it. I don\'t believe he could swim. Tony, are you mad, or');
lines.push('am I? Or is this a new game?"');
lines.push('Antony squeezed his arm.');
lines.push('"Dear old Bill," he said. "It\'s a game. What a game! And the answer is');
lines.push('Cartwright in Wimpole Street."');
lines.push('They walked in silence for half a mile or so along the road to Waldheim.');
lines.push('Bill tried two or three times to get his friend to talk, but Antony had');
lines.push('only grunted in reply. He was just going to make another attempt, when');
lines.push('Antony came to a sudden stop and turned to him anxiously.');
lines.push('"I wonder if you\'d do something for me," he said, looking at him with');
lines.push('some doubt.');
lines.push('"What sort of thing?"');
lines.push('"Well, it\'s really dashed important. It\'s just the one thing I want');
lines.push('now."');
lines.push('Bill was suddenly enthusiastic again.');
lines.push('"I say, have you really found it all out?"');
lines.push('Antony nodded.');
lines.push('"At least, I\'m very nearly there, Bill. There\'s just this one thing I');
lines.push('want now. It means your going back to Stanton. Well, we haven\'t come');
lines.push('far; it won\'t take you long. Do you mind?"');
lines.push('"My dear Holmes, I am at your service."');
lines.push('Antony gave him a smile and was silent for a little, thinking.');
lines.push('"Is there another inn at Stanton--fairly close to the station?"');
lines.push('"The \'Plough and Horses\'--just at the corner where the road goes up to');
lines.push('the station--is that the one you mean?"');
lines.push('"That would be the one. I suppose you could do with a drink, couldn\'t');
lines.push('you?"');
lines.push('"Rather!" said Bill, with a grin.');
lines.push('"Good. Then have one at the \'Plough and Horses.\' Have two, if you like,');
lines.push('and talk to the landlord, or landlady, or whoever serves you. I want you');
lines.push('to find out if anybody stayed there on Monday night."');
lines.push('"Robert?" said Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('"I didn\'t say Robert," said Antony, smiling. "I just want you to find');
lines.push('out if they had a visitor who slept there on Monday night. A stranger.');
lines.push('If so, then any particulars you can get of him, without letting the');
lines.push('landlord know that you are interested--"');
lines.push('"Leave it to me," broke in Bill. "I know just what you want."');
lines.push('"Don\'t assume that it was Robert--or anybody else. Let them describe the');
lines.push('man to you. Don\'t influence them unconsciously by suggesting that he was');
lines.push('short or tall, or anything of that sort. Just get them talking. If it\'s');
lines.push('the landlord, you\'d better stand him a drink or two."');
lines.push('"Right you are," said Bill confidently. "Where do I meet you again?"');
lines.push('"Probably at \'The George.\' If you get there before me, you can order');
lines.push('dinner for eight o\'clock. Anyhow we\'ll meet at eight, if not before."');
lines.push('"Good." He nodded to Antony and strode off back to Stanton again.');
lines.push('Antony stood watching him with a little smile at his enthusiasm. Then he');
lines.push('looked round slowly, as if in search of something. Suddenly he saw what');
lines.push('he wanted. Twenty yards farther on a lane wandered off to the left, and');
lines.push('there was a gate a little way up on the right-hand side of it. Antony');
lines.push('walked to the gate, filling his pipe as he went. Then he lit his pipe,');
lines.push('sat on the gate, and took his head in his hands.');
lines.push('"Now then," he said to himself, "let\'s begin at the beginning."');
lines.push('It was nearly eight o\'clock when William Beverley, the famous');
lines.push('sleuth-hound, arrived, tired and dusty, at \'The George,\' to find Antony,');
lines.push('cool and clean, standing bare-headed at the door, waiting for him.');
lines.push('"Is dinner ready?" were Bill\'s first words.');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"Then I\'ll just have a wash. Lord, I\'m tired."');
lines.push('"I never ought to have asked you," said Antony penitently.');
lines.push('"That\'s all right. I shan\'t be a moment." Half-way up the stairs he');
lines.push('turned round and asked, "Am I in your room?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Do you know the way?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Start carving, will you? And order lots of beer." He disappeared');
lines.push('round the top of the staircase. Antony went slowly in.');
lines.push('When the first edge of his appetite had worn off, and he was able to');
lines.push('spare a little time between the mouthfuls, Bill gave an account of his');
lines.push('adventures. The landlord of the "Plough and Horses" had been sticky,');
lines.push('decidedly sticky--Bill had been unable at first to get anything out of');
lines.push('him. But Bill had been tactful; lorblessyou, how tactful he had been.');
lines.push('"He kept on about the inquest, and what a queer affair it had been, and');
lines.push('so on, and how there\'d been an inquest in his wife\'s family once,');
lines.push('which he seemed rather proud about, and I kept saying, \'Pretty busy, I');
lines.push('suppose, just now, what?\' and then he\'d say, \'Middlin\',\' and go on again');
lines.push('about Susan--that was the one that had the inquest--he talked about it');
lines.push('as if it were a disease--and then I\'d try again, and say, \'Slack times,');
lines.push('I expect, just now, eh?\' and he\'d say \'Middlin\' again, and then it was');
lines.push('time to offer him another drink, and I didn\'t seem to be getting much');
lines.push('nearer. But I got him at last. I asked him if he knew John Borden--he');
lines.push('was the man who said he\'d seen Mark at the station. Well, he knew all');
lines.push('about Borden, and after he\'d told me all about Borden\'s wife\'s family,');
lines.push('and how one of them had been burnt to death--after you with the beer;');
lines.push('thanks--well, then I said carelessly that it must be very hard to');
lines.push('remember anybody whom you had just seen once, so as to identify him');
lines.push('afterwards, and he agreed that it would be \'middlin\' hard,\' and then--"');
lines.push('"Give me three guesses," interrupted Antony. "You asked him if he');
lines.push('remembered everybody who came to his inn?"');
lines.push('"That\'s it. Bright, wasn\'t it?"');
lines.push('"Brilliant. And what was the result?"');
lines.push('"The result was a woman."');
lines.push('"A woman?" said Antony eagerly.');
lines.push('"A woman," said Bill impressively. "Of course I thought it was going to');
lines.push('be Robert--so did you, didn\'t you?--but it wasn\'t. It was a woman. Came');
lines.push('quite late on Monday night in a car--driving herself--went off early');
lines.push('next morning."');
lines.push('"Did he describe her?"');
lines.push('"Yes. She was middlin\'. Middlin\' tall, middlin\' age, middlin\' colour,');
lines.push('and so on. Doesn\'t help much, does it? But still--a woman. Does that');
lines.push('upset your theory?"');
lines.push('Antony shook his head.');
lines.push('"No, Bill, not at all," he said.');
lines.push('"You knew all the time? At least, you guessed?"');
lines.push('"Wait till to-morrow. I\'ll tell you everything to-morrow."');
lines.push('"To-morrow!" said Bill in great disappointment.');
lines.push('"Well, I\'ll tell you one thing to-night, if you\'ll promise not to ask');
lines.push('any more questions. But you probably know it already."');
lines.push('"What is it?"');
lines.push('"Only that Mark Ablett did not kill his brother."');
lines.push('"And Cayley did?"');
lines.push('"That\'s another question, Bill. However, the answer is that Cayley');
lines.push('didn\'t, either."');
lines.push('"Then who on earth--"');
lines.push('"Have some more beer," said Antony with a smile. And Bill had to be');
lines.push('content with that.');
lines.push('They were early to bed that evening, for both of them were tired. Bill');
lines.push('slept loudly and defiantly, but Antony lay awake, wondering. What was');
lines.push('happening at the Red House now? Perhaps he would hear in the morning;');
lines.push('perhaps he would get a letter. He went over the whole story again from');
lines.push('the beginning--was there any possibility of a mistake? What would the');
lines.push('police do? Would they ever find out? Ought he to have told them? Well,');
lines.push('let them find out; it was their job. Surely he couldn\'t have made a');
lines.push('mistake this time. No good wondering now; he would know definitely in');
lines.push('the morning.');
lines.push('In the morning there was a letter for him.');
lines.push('CHAPTER XXI. Cayley\'s Apology');
lines.push('"My Dear Mr. Gillingham,');
lines.push('"I gather from your letter that you have made certain discoveries which');
lines.push('you may feel it your duty to communicate to the police, and that in this');
lines.push('case my arrest on a charge of murder would inevitably follow. Why,');
lines.push('in these circumstances, you should give me such ample warning of your');
lines.push('intentions I do not understand, unless it is that you are not wholly out');
lines.push('of sympathy with me. But whether or not you sympathize, at any rate you');
lines.push('will want to know--and I want you to know--the exact manner in which');
lines.push('Ablett met his death and the reasons which made that death necessary. If');
lines.push('the police have to be told anything, I would rather that they too knew');
lines.push('the whole story. They, and even you, may call it murder, but by that');
lines.push('time I shall be out of the way. Let them call it what they like.');
lines.push('"I must begin by taking you back to a summer day fifteen years ago, when');
lines.push('I was a boy of thirteen and Mark a young man of twenty-five. His');
lines.push('whole life was make-believe, and just now he was pretending to be a');
lines.push('philanthropist. He sat in our little drawing-room, flicking his gloves');
lines.push('against the back of his left hand, and my mother, good soul, thought');
lines.push('what a noble young gentleman he was, and Philip and I, hastily washed');
lines.push('and crammed into collars, stood in front of him, nudging each other and');
lines.push('kicking the backs of our heels and cursing him in our hearts for having');
lines.push('interrupted our game. He had decided to adopt one of us, kind Cousin');
lines.push('Mark. Heaven knows why he chose me. Philip was eleven; two years longer');
lines.push('to wait. Perhaps that was why.');
lines.push('"Well, Mark educated me. I went to a public school and to Cambridge,');
lines.push('and I became his secretary. Well, much more than his secretary as your');
lines.push('friend Beverley perhaps has told you: his land agent, his financial');
lines.push('adviser, his courier, his--but this most of all--his audience. Mark');
lines.push('could never live alone. There must always be somebody to listen to him.');
lines.push('I think in his heart he hoped I should be his Boswell. He told me one');
lines.push('day that he had made me his literary executor--poor devil. And he used');
lines.push('to write me the absurdest long letters when I was away from him, letters');
lines.push('which I read once and then tore up. The futility of the man!');
lines.push('"It was three years ago that Philip got into trouble. He had been');
lines.push('hurried through a cheap grammar school and into a London office, and');
lines.push('discovered there that there was not much fun to be got in this world on');
lines.push('two pounds a week. I had a frantic letter from him one day, saying that');
lines.push('he must have a hundred at once, or he would be ruined, and I went to');
lines.push('Mark for the money. Only to borrow it, you understand; he gave me a good');
lines.push('salary and I could have paid it back in three months. But no. He saw');
lines.push('nothing for himself in it, I suppose; no applause, no admiration.');
lines.push('Philip\'s gratitude would be to me, not to him. I begged, I threatened,');
lines.push('we argued; and while we were arguing, Philip was arrested. It killed');
lines.push('my mother--he was always her favourite--but Mark, as usual, got his');
lines.push('satisfaction out of it. He preened himself on his judgment of character');
lines.push('in having chosen me and not Philip twelve years before!');
lines.push('"Later on I apologized to Mark for the reckless things I had said');
lines.push('to him, and he played the part of a magnanimous gentleman with his');
lines.push('accustomed skill, but, though outwardly we were as before to each other,');
lines.push('from that day forward, though his vanity would never let him see it, I');
lines.push('was his bitterest enemy. If that had been all, I wonder if I should have');
lines.push('killed him? To live on terms of intimate friendship with a man whom you');
lines.push('hate is dangerous work for your friend. Because of his belief in me');
lines.push('as his admiring and grateful protege and his belief in himself as my');
lines.push('benefactor, he was now utterly in my power. I could take my time and');
lines.push('choose my opportunity. Perhaps I should not have killed him, but I had');
lines.push('sworn to have my revenge--and there he was, poor vain fool, at my mercy.');
lines.push('I was in no hurry.');
lines.push('"Two years later I had to reconsider my position, for my revenge was');
lines.push('being taken out of my hands. Mark began to drink. Could I have stopped');
lines.push('him? I don\'t think so, but to my immense surprise I found myself trying');
lines.push('to. Instinct, perhaps, getting the better of reason; or did I reason it');
lines.push('out and tell myself that, if he drank himself to death, I should lose');
lines.push('my revenge? Upon my word, I cannot tell you; but, for whatever motive, I');
lines.push('did genuinely want to stop it. Drinking is such a beastly thing, anyhow.');
lines.push('"I could not stop him, but I kept him within certain bounds, so that');
lines.push('nobody but myself knew his secret. Yes, I kept him outwardly decent;');
lines.push('and perhaps now I was becoming like the cannibal who keeps his victim in');
lines.push('good condition for his own ends. I used to gloat over Mark, thinking how');
lines.push('utterly he was mine to ruin as I pleased, financially, morally, whatever');
lines.push('way would give me most satisfaction. I had but to take my hand away from');
lines.push('him and he sank. But again I was in no hurry.');
lines.push('"Then he killed himself. That futile little drunkard, eaten up with his');
lines.push('own selfishness and vanity, offered his beastliness to the truest and');
lines.push('purest woman on this earth. You have seen her, Mr. Gillingham, but you');
lines.push('never knew Mark Ablett. Even if he had not been a drunkard, there was');
lines.push('no chance for her of happiness with him. I had known him for many years,');
lines.push('but never once had I seen him moved by any generous emotion. To have');
lines.push('lived with that shrivelled little soul would have been hell for her; and');
lines.push('a thousand times worse hell when he began to drink.');
lines.push('"So he had to be killed. I was the only one left to protect her, for');
lines.push('her mother was in league with Mark to bring about her ruin. I would have');
lines.push('shot him openly for her sake, and with what gladness, but I had no mind');
lines.push('to sacrifice myself needlessly. He was in my power; I could persuade him');
lines.push('to almost anything by flattery; surely it would not be difficult to give');
lines.push('his death the appearance of an accident.');
lines.push('"I need not take up your time by telling you of the many plans I made');
lines.push('and rejected. For some days I inclined towards an unfortunate boating');
lines.push('accident in the pond--Mark, a very indifferent swimmer, myself almost');
lines.push('exhausted in a gallant attempt to hold him up. And then he himself gave');
lines.push('me the idea, he and Miss Norris between them, and so put himself in');
lines.push('my hands; without risk of discovery, I should have said, had you not');
lines.push('discovered me.');
lines.push('"We were talking about ghosts. Mark had been even more vain, pompous and');
lines.push('absurd than usual, and I could see that Miss Norris was irritated by it.');
lines.push('After dinner she suggested dressing up as a ghost and frightening him.');
lines.push('I thought it my duty to warn her that Mark took any joke against');
lines.push('himself badly, but she was determined to do it. I gave way reluctantly.');
lines.push('Reluctantly, also, I told her the secret of the passage. (There is an');
lines.push('underground passage from the library to the bowling-green. You should');
lines.push('exercise your ingenuity, Mr. Gillingham, in trying to discover it. Mark');
lines.push('came upon it by accident a year ago. It was a godsend to him; he could');
lines.push('drink there in greater secrecy. But he had to tell me about it. He');
lines.push('wanted an audience, even for his vices.)');
lines.push('"I told Miss Norris, then, because it was necessary for my plan that');
lines.push('Mark should be thoroughly frightened. Without the passage she could');
lines.push('never have got close enough to the bowling-green to alarm him properly,');
lines.push('but as I arranged it with her she made the most effective appearance,');
lines.push('and Mark was in just the state of rage and vindictiveness which I');
lines.push('required. Miss Norris, you understand, is a professional actress. I need');
lines.push('not say that to her I appeared to be animated by no other feeling than a');
lines.push('boyish desire to bring off a good joke--a joke directed as much against');
lines.push('the others as against Mark.');
lines.push('"He came to me that night, as I expected, still quivering with');
lines.push('indignation. Miss Norris must never be asked to the house again; I was');
lines.push('to make a special note of it; never again. It was outrageous. Had he not');
lines.push('a reputation as a host to keep up, he would pack her off next morning.');
lines.push('As it was, she could stay; hospitality demanded it; but never again');
lines.push('would she come to the Red House--he was absolutely determined about');
lines.push('that. I was to make a special note of it.');
lines.push('"I comforted him, I smoothed down his ruffled feathers. She had behaved');
lines.push('very badly, but he was quite right; he must try not to show how much he');
lines.push('disapproved of her. And of course she would never come again--that');
lines.push('was obvious. And then suddenly I began to laugh. He looked up at me');
lines.push('indignantly.');
lines.push('"\'Is there a joke?" he said coldly.');
lines.push('"I laughed gently again.');
lines.push('"\'I was just thinking,\' I said, \'that it would be rather amusing if');
lines.push('you--well, had your revenge."');
lines.push('"\'My revenge? How do you mean?\'');
lines.push('"\'Well, paid her back in her own coin.\'');
lines.push('"\'Do you mean try and frighten her?\'');
lines.push('"\'No, no; but dressed up and pulled her leg a bit. Made her look a fool');
lines.push('in front of the others.\' I laughed to myself again. \'Serve her jolly');
lines.push('well right.\'');
lines.push('"He jumped up excitedly.');
lines.push('"\'By Jove, Cay!\' he cried. \'If I could! How? You must think of a way.');
lines.push('"I don\'t know if Beverley has told you about Mark\'s acting. He was an');
lines.push('amateur of all the arts, and vain of his little talents, but as an actor');
lines.push('he seemed to himself most wonderful. Certainly he had some ability for');
lines.push('the stage, so long as he had the stage to himself and was playing to an');
lines.push('admiring audience. As a professional actor in a small part he would have');
lines.push('been hopeless; as an amateur playing the leading part, he deserved all');
lines.push('that the local papers had ever said about him. And so the idea of giving');
lines.push('us a private performance, directed against a professional actress who');
lines.push('had made fun of him, appealed equally to his vanity and his desire for');
lines.push('retaliation. If he, Mark Ablett, by his wonderful acting could make Ruth');
lines.push('Norris look a fool in front of the others, could take her in, and then');
lines.push('join in the laugh at her afterwards, he would indeed have had a worthy');
lines.push('revenge!');
lines.push('"It strikes you as childish, Mr. Gillingham? Ah, you never knew Mark');
lines.push('Ablett.');
lines.push('"\'How, Cay, how?\' he said eagerly.');
lines.push('"\'Well, I haven\'t really thought it out,\' I protested. \'It was just an');
lines.push('idea.\'');
lines.push('"He began to think it out for himself.');
lines.push('"\'I might pretend to be a manager, come down to see her--but I suppose');
lines.push('she knows them all. What about an interviewer?\'');
lines.push('"\'It\'s going to be difficult,\' I said thoughtfully. \'You\'ve got rather a');
lines.push('characteristic face, you know. And your beard--\'');
lines.push('"\'I\'d shave it off,\' he snapped.');
lines.push('"\'My dear Mark!\'');
lines.push('"He looked away, and mumbled, \'I\'ve been thinking of taking it off,');
lines.push('anyhow. And besides, if I\'m going to do the thing, I\'m going to do it');
lines.push('properly.\'');
lines.push('"\'Yes, you always were an artist,\' I said, looking at him admiringly.');
lines.push('"He purred. To be called an artist was what he longed for most. Now I');
lines.push('knew that I had him.');
lines.push('"\'All the same,\' I went on, \'even without your beard and moustache you');
lines.push('might be recognizable. Unless, of course--\' I broke off.');
lines.push('"\'Unless what?\'');
lines.push('"\'You pretend to be Robert.\' I began to laugh to myself again. \'By');
lines.push('Jove!\' I said, \'that\'s not a bad idea. Pretend to be Robert, the wastrel');
lines.push('brother, and make yourself objectionable to Miss Norris. Borrow money');
lines.push('from her, and that sort of thing.\'');
lines.push('"He looked at me, with his bright little eyes, nodding eagerly.');
lines.push('"\'Robert,\' he said. \'Yes. How shall we work it?\'');
lines.push('"There was really a Robert, Mr. Gillingham, as I have no doubt you');
lines.push('and the Inspector both discovered. And he was a wastrel and he went to');
lines.push('Australia. But he never came to the Red House on Tuesday afternoon. He');
lines.push('couldn\'t have, because he died (unlamented) three years ago. But there');
lines.push('was nobody who knew this, save Mark and myself, for Mark was the only');
lines.push('one of the family left, his sister having died last year. Though I');
lines.push('doubt, anyhow, if she knew whether Robert was alive or dead. He was not');
lines.push('talked about.');
lines.push('"For the next two days Mark and I worked out our plans. You understand');
lines.push('by now that our aims were not identical. Mark\'s endeavour was that his');
lines.push('deception should last for, say, a couple of hours; mine that it should');
lines.push('go to the grave with him. He had only to deceive Miss Norris and the');
lines.push('other guests; I had to deceive the world. When he was dressed up as');
lines.push('Robert, I was going to kill him. Robert would then be dead, Mark (of');
lines.push('course) missing. What could anybody think but that Mark had killed');
lines.push('Robert? But you see how important it was for Mark to enter fully into');
lines.push('his latest (and last) impersonation. Half-measures would be fatal.');
lines.push('"You will say that it was impossible to do the thing thoroughly enough.');
lines.push('I answer again that you never knew Mark. He was being what he wished');
lines.push('most to be--an artist. No Othello ever blacked himself all over with');
lines.push('such enthusiasm as did Mark. His beard was going anyhow--possible a');
lines.push('chance remark of Miss Norbury\'s helped here. She did not like beards.');
lines.push('But it was important for me that the dead man\'s hands should not be the');
lines.push('hands of a manicured gentleman. Five minutes playing upon the vanity of');
lines.push('the artist settled his hands. He let the nails grow and then cut them');
lines.push('raggedly. \'Miss Norris would notice your hands at once,\' I had said.');
lines.push('\'Besides, as an artist--\'');
lines.push('"So with his underclothes. It was hardly necessary to warn him that');
lines.push('his pants might show above the edge of his socks; as an artist he had');
lines.push('already decided upon Robertian pants. I bought them, and other things,');
lines.push('in London for him. Even if I had not cut out all trace of the maker\'s');
lines.push('name, he would instinctively have done it. As an Australian and an');
lines.push('artist, he could not have an East London address on his underclothes.');
lines.push('Yes, we were doing the thing thoroughly, both of us; he as an artist, I');
lines.push('as a--well, you may say murderer, if you like. I shall not mind now.');
lines.push('"Our plans were settled. I went to London on the Monday and wrote him');
lines.push('a letter from Robert. (The artistic touch again.) I also bought a');
lines.push('revolver. On the Tuesday morning he announced the arrival of Robert');
lines.push('at the breakfast-table. Robert was now alive--we had six witnesses to');
lines.push('prove it; six witnesses who knew that he was coming that afternoon. Our');
lines.push('private plan was that Robert should present himself at three o\'clock,');
lines.push('in readiness for the return of the golfing-party shortly afterwards. The');
lines.push('maid would go to look for Mark, and having failed to find him, come back');
lines.push('to the office to find me entertaining Robert in Mark\'s absence. I');
lines.push('would explain that Mark must have gone out somewhere, and would myself');
lines.push('introduce the wastrel brother to the tea-table. Mark\'s absence would not');
lines.push('excite any comment, for it would be generally felt--indeed Robert would');
lines.push('suggest it--that he had been afraid of meeting his brother. Then Robert');
lines.push('would make himself amusingly offensive to the guests, particularly, of');
lines.push('course, Miss Norris, until he thought that the joke had gone far enough.');
lines.push('"That was our private plan. Perhaps I should say that it was Mark\'s');
lines.push('private plan. My own was different.');
lines.push('"The announcement at breakfast went well. After the golfing-party had');
lines.push('gone off, we had the morning in which to complete our arrangements. What');
lines.push('I was chiefly concerned about was to establish as completely as possible');
lines.push('the identity of Robert. For this reason I suggested to Mark that, when');
lines.push('dressed, he should go out by the secret passage to the bowling-green,');
lines.push('and come back by the drive, taking care to enter into conversation');
lines.push('with the lodge-keeper. In this way I would have two more witnesses');
lines.push('of Robert\'s arrival--first the lodge-keeper, and secondly one of the');
lines.push('gardeners whom I would have working on the front lawn. Mark, of course,');
lines.push('was willing enough. He could practise his Australian accent on the');
lines.push('lodge-keeper. It was really amusing to see how readily he fell into');
lines.push('every suggestion which I made. Never was a killing more carefully');
lines.push('planned by its victim.');
lines.push('"He changed into Robert\'s clothes in the office bedroom. This was the');
lines.push('safest way--for both of us. When he was ready, he called me in, and');
lines.push('I inspected him. It was extraordinary how well he looked the part. I');
lines.push('suppose that the signs of his dissipation had already marked themselves');
lines.push('on his face, but had been concealed hitherto by his moustache and');
lines.push('beard; for now that he was clean-shaven they lay open to the world from');
lines.push('which we had so carefully hidden them, and he was indeed the wastrel');
lines.push('which he was pretending to be.');
lines.push('"\'By Jove, you\'re wonderful,\' I said.');
lines.push('"He smirked, and called my attention to the various artistic touches');
lines.push('which I might have missed.');
lines.push('"\'Wonderful,\' I said to myself again. \'Nobody could possibly guess.\'');
lines.push('"I peered into the hall. It was empty. We hurried across to the library;');
lines.push('he got into the passage and made off. I went back to the bedroom,');
lines.push('collected all his discarded clothes, did them up in a bundle and');
lines.push('returned with them to the passage. Then I sat down in the hall and');
lines.push('waited.');
lines.push('"You heard the evidence of Stevens, the maid. As soon as she was on her');
lines.push('way to the Temple in search of Mark, I stepped into the office. My hand');
lines.push('was in my side-pocket, and in my hand was the revolver.');
lines.push('"He began at once in his character of Robert--some rigmarole about');
lines.push('working his passage over from Australia; a little private performance');
lines.push('for my edification. Then in his natural voice, gloating over his');
lines.push('well-planned retaliation on Miss Norris, he burst out, \'It\'s my turn');
lines.push('now. You wait.\' It was this which Elsie heard. She had no business to be');
lines.push('there and she might have ruined everything, but as it turned out it was');
lines.push('the luckiest thing which could have happened. For it was the one piece');
lines.push('of evidence which I wanted; evidence, other than my own, that Mark and');
lines.push('Robert were in the room together.');
lines.push('"I said nothing. I was not going to take the risk of being heard to');
lines.push('speak in that room. I just smiled at the poor little fool, and took');
lines.push('out my revolver, and shot him. Then I went back into the library and');
lines.push('waited--just as I said in my evidence.');
lines.push('"Can you imagine, Mr. Gillingham, the shock which your sudden appearance');
lines.push('gave me? Can you imagine the feelings of a \'murderer\' who has (as he');
lines.push('thinks) planned for every possibility, and is then confronted suddenly');
lines.push('with an utterly new problem? What difference would your coming make? I');
lines.push('didn\'t know. Perhaps none; perhaps all. And I had forgotten to open the');
lines.push('window!');
lines.push('"I don\'t know whether you will think my plan for killing Mark a clever');
lines.push('one. Perhaps not. But if I do deserve any praise in the matter, I think');
lines.push('I deserve it for the way I pulled myself together in the face of the');
lines.push('unexpected catastrophe of your arrival. Yes, I got a window open, Mr.');
lines.push('Gillingham, under your very nose; the right window too, you were kind');
lines.push('enough to say. And the keys--yes, that was clever of you, but I think I');
lines.push('was cleverer. I deceived you over the keys, Mr. Gillingham, as I');
lines.push('learnt when I took the liberty of listening to a conversation on the');
lines.push('bowling-green between you and your friend Beverley. Where was I? Ah, you');
lines.push('must have a look for that secret passage, Mr. Gillingham.');
lines.push('"But what am I saying? Did I deceive you at all? You have found out the');
lines.push('secret--that Robert was Mark--and that is all that matters. How have');
lines.push('you found out? I shall never know now. Where did I go wrong? Perhaps you');
lines.push('have been deceiving me all the time. Perhaps you knew about the keys,');
lines.push('about the window, even about the secret passage. You are a clever man,');
lines.push('Mr. Gillingham.');
lines.push('"I had Mark\'s clothes on my hands. I might have left them in the');
lines.push('passage, but the secret of the passage was now out. Miss Norris knew');
lines.push('it. That was the weak point of my plan, perhaps, that Miss Norris had');
lines.push('to know it. So I hid them in the pond, the Inspector having obligingly');
lines.push('dragged it for me first. A couple of keys joined them, but I kept the');
lines.push('revolver. Fortunate, wasn\'t it, Mr. Gillingham?');
lines.push('"I don\'t think that there is any more to tell you. This is a long');
lines.push('letter, but then it is the last which I shall write. There was a time');
lines.push('when I hoped that there might be a happy future for me, not at the Red');
lines.push('House, not alone. Perhaps it was never more than an idle day-dream,');
lines.push('for I am no more worthy of her than Mark was. But I could have made her');
lines.push('happy, Mr. Gillingham. God, how I would have worked to make her happy!');
lines.push('But now that is impossible. To offer her the hand of a murderer would be');
lines.push('as bad as to offer her the hand of a drunkard. And Mark died for that.');
lines.push('I saw her this morning. She was very sweet. It is a difficult world to');
lines.push('understand.');
lines.push('"Well, well, we are all gone now--the Abletts and the Cayleys. I wonder');
lines.push('what old Grandfather Cayley thinks of it all. Perhaps it is as well that');
lines.push('we have died out. Not that there was anything wrong with Sarah--except');
lines.push('her temper. And she had the Ablett nose--you can\'t do much with that.');
lines.push('I\'m glad she left no children.');
lines.push('"Good-bye, Mr. Gillingham. I\'m sorry that your stay with us was not of');
lines.push('a pleasanter nature, but you understand the difficulties in which I was');
lines.push('placed. Don\'t let Bill think too badly of me. He is a good fellow; look');
lines.push('after him. He will be surprised. The young are always surprised. And');
lines.push('thank you for letting me end my own way. I expect you did sympathize a');
lines.push('little, you know. We might have been friends in another world--you and');
lines.push('I, and I and she. Tell her what you like. Everything or nothing. You');
lines.push('will know what is best. Good-bye, Mr. Gillingham.');
lines.push('"MATTHEW CAYLEY.');
lines.push('"I am lonely to-night without Mark. That\'s funny, isn\'t it?"');
lines.push('CHAPTER XXII. Mr. Beverley Moves On');
lines.push('"Good Lord!" said Bill, as he put down the letter.');
lines.push('"I thought you\'d say that," murmured Antony.');
lines.push('"Tony, do you mean to say that you knew all this?"');
lines.push('"I guessed some of it. I didn\'t quite know all of it, of course."');
lines.push('"Good Lord!" said Bill again, and returned to the letter. In a moment he');
lines.push('was looking up again. "What did you write to him? Was that last night?');
lines.push('After I\'d gone into Stanton?"');
lines.push('"Yes."');
lines.push('"What did you say? That you\'d discovered that Mark was Robert?"');
lines.push('"Yes. At least I said that this morning I should probably telegraph to');
lines.push('Mr. Cartwright of Wimpole Street, and ask him to--"');
lines.push('Bill burst in eagerly on the top of the sentence. "Yes, now what was all');
lines.push('that about? You were so damn Sherlocky yesterday all of a sudden. We\'d');
lines.push('been doing the thing together all the time, and you\'d been telling me');
lines.push('everything, and then suddenly you become very mysterious and private and');
lines.push('talk enigmatically--is that the word?--about dentists and swimming and');
lines.push('the \'Plough and Horses,\' and--well, what was it all about? You simply');
lines.push('vanished out of sight; I didn\'t know what on earth we were talking');
lines.push('about."');
lines.push('Antony laughed and apologized.');
lines.push('"Sorry, Bill. I felt like that suddenly. Just for the last half-hour;');
lines.push('just to end up with. I\'ll tell you everything now. Not that there\'s');
lines.push('anything to tell, really. It seems so easy when you know it--so obvious.');
lines.push('About Mr. Cartwright of Wimpole Street. Of course he was just to');
lines.push('identify the body."');
lines.push('"But whatever made you think of a dentist for that?"');
lines.push('"Who could do it better? Could you have done it? How could you? You\'d');
lines.push('never gone bathing with Mark; you\'d never seen him stripped. He didn\'t');
lines.push('swim. Could his doctor do it? Not unless he\'d had some particular');
lines.push('operation, and perhaps not then. But his dentists could--at any time,');
lines.push('always--if he had been to his dentist fairly often. Hence Mr. Cartwright');
lines.push('of Wimpole Street."');
lines.push('Bill nodded thoughtfully and went back again to the letter.');
lines.push('"I see. And you told Cayley that you were telegraphing to Cartwright to');
lines.push('identify the body?"');
lines.push('"Yes. And then of course it was all up for him. Once we knew that Robert');
lines.push('was Mark we knew everything."');
lines.push('"How did you know?"');
lines.push('Antony got up from the breakfast table and began to fill his pipe.');
lines.push('"I\'m not sure that I can say, Bill. You know those problems in Algebra');
lines.push('where you say, \'Let x be the answer,\' and then you work it out and find');
lines.push('what x is. Well, that\'s one way; and another way, which they never give');
lines.push('you any marks for at school, is to guess the answer. Pretend the answer');
lines.push('is 4--well, will that satisfy the conditions of the problem? No. Then');
lines.push('try 6; and if 6 doesn\'t either, then what about 5?--and so on. Well, the');
lines.push('Inspector and the Coroner and all that lot had guessed their answer, and');
lines.push('it seemed to fit, but you and I knew it didn\'t really fit; there were');
lines.push('several conditions in the problem which it didn\'t fit at all. So we knew');
lines.push('that their answer was wrong, and we had to think of another--an answer');
lines.push('which explained all the things which were puzzling us. Well, I happened');
lines.push('to guess the right one. Got a match?"');
lines.push('Bill handed him a box, and he lit his pipe.');
lines.push('"Yes, but that doesn\'t quite do, old boy. Something must have put you');
lines.push('on to it suddenly. By the way, I\'ll have my matches back, if you don\'t');
lines.push('mind."');
lines.push('Antony laughed and took them out of his pocket.');
lines.push('"Sorry.... Well then, let\'s see if I can go through my own mind again,');
lines.push('and tell you how I guessed it. First of all, the clothes."');
lines.push('"Yes?"');
lines.push('"To Cayley the clothes seemed an enormously important clue. I didn\'t');
lines.push('quite see why, but I did realize that to a man in Cayley\'s position the');
lines.push('smallest clue would have an entirely disproportionate value. For some');
lines.push('reason, then, Cayley attached this exaggerated importance to the clothes');
lines.push('which Mark was wearing on that Tuesday morning; all the clothes, the');
lines.push('inside ones as well as the outside ones. I didn\'t know why, but I');
lines.push('did feel certain that, in that case, the absence of the collar was');
lines.push('unintentional. In collecting the clothes he had overlooked the collar.');
lines.push('Why?"');
lines.push('"It was the one in the linen-basket?"');
lines.push('"Yes. It seemed probable. Why had Cayley put it there? The obvious');
lines.push('answer was that he hadn\'t. Mark had put it there. I remembered what you');
lines.push('told me about Mark being finicky, and having lots of clothes and so on,');
lines.push('and I felt that he was just the sort of man who would never wear the');
lines.push('same collar twice." He paused, and then asked, "Is that right, do you');
lines.push('think?"');
lines.push('"Absolutely," said Bill with conviction.');
lines.push('"Well, I guessed it was. So then I began to see an x which would fit');
lines.push('just this part of the problem--the clothes part. I saw Mark changing');
lines.push('his clothes; I saw him instinctively dropping the collar in the');
lines.push('linen-basket, just as he had always dropped every collar he had ever');
lines.push('taken off, but leaving the rest of the clothes on a chair in');
lines.push('the ordinary way; and I saw Cayley collecting all the clothes');
lines.push('afterwards--all the visible clothes--and not realizing that the collar');
lines.push('wasn\'t there."');
lines.push('"Go on," said Bill eagerly.');
lines.push('"Well, I felt pretty sure about that, and I wanted an explanation of');
lines.push('it. Why had Mark changed down there instead of in his bedroom? The only');
lines.push('answer was that the fact of his changing had to be kept secret. When did');
lines.push('he change? The only possible time was between lunch (when he would be');
lines.push('seen by the servants) and the moment of Robert\'s arrival. And when');
lines.push('did Cayley collect the clothes in a bundle? Again, the only answer was');
lines.push('\'Before Robert\'s arrival.\' So another x was wanted--to fit those three');
lines.push('conditions."');
lines.push('"And the answer was that a murder was intended, even before Robert');
lines.push('arrived?"');
lines.push('"Yes. Well now, it couldn\'t be intended on the strength of that letter,');
lines.push('unless there was very much more behind the letter than we knew. Nor was');
lines.push('it possible a murder could be intended without any more preparation than');
lines.push('the changing into a different suit in which to escape. The thing was too');
lines.push('childish. Also, if Robert was to be murdered, why go out of the way to');
lines.push('announce his existence to you all--even, at the cost of some trouble, to');
lines.push('Mrs. Norbury? What did it all mean? I didn\'t know. But I began to');
lines.push('feel now that Robert was an incident only; that the plot was a plot of');
lines.push('Cayley\'s against Mark--either to get him to kill his brother, or to');
lines.push('get his brother to kill him--and that for some inexplicable reason Mark');
lines.push('seemed to be lending himself to the plot." He was silent for a little,');
lines.push('and then said, almost to himself, "I had seen the empty brandy bottles');
lines.push('in that cupboard."');
lines.push('"You never said anything about them" complained Bill.');
lines.push('"I only saw them afterwards. I was looking for the collar, you remember.');
lines.push('They came back to me afterwards; I knew how Cayley would feel about');
lines.push('it.... Poor devil!"');
lines.push('"Go on," said Bill.');
lines.push('"Well, then, we had the inquest, and of course I noticed, and I suppose');
lines.push('you did too, the curious fact that Robert had asked his way at the');
lines.push('second lodge and not at the first. So I talked to Amos and Parsons. That');
lines.push('made it more curious. Amos told me that Robert had gone out of his way');
lines.push('to speak to him; had called to him, in fact. Parsons told me that');
lines.push('his wife was out in their little garden at the first lodge all the');
lines.push('afternoon, and was certain that Robert had never come past it. He also');
lines.push('told me that Cayley had put him on to a job on the front lawn');
lines.push('that afternoon. So I had another guess. Robert had used the secret');
lines.push('passage--the passage which comes out into the park between the first and');
lines.push('second lodges. Robert, then, had been in the house; it was a put-up job');
lines.push('between Robert and Cayley. But how could Robert be there without Mark');
lines.push('knowing? Obviously, Mark knew too. What did it all mean?"');
lines.push('"When was this?" interrupted Bill. "Just after the inquest--after you\'d');
lines.push('seen Amos and Parsons, of course?"');
lines.push('"Yes. I got up and left them, and came to look for you. I\'d got back to');
lines.push('the clothes then. Why did Mark change his clothes so secretly? Disguise?');
lines.push('But then what about his face? That was much more important than clothes.');
lines.push('His face, his beard--he\'d have to shave off his beard--and then--oh,');
lines.push('idiot! I saw you looking at that poster. Mark acting, Mark made-up, Mark');
lines.push('disguised. Oh, priceless idiot! Mark was Robert.... Matches, please."');
lines.push('Bill passed over the matches again, waited till Antony had relit his');
lines.push('pipe, and then held out his hand for them, just as they were going into');
lines.push('the other\'s pocket.');
lines.push('"Yes," said Bill thoughtfully. "Yes.... But wait a moment. What about');
lines.push('the \'Plough and Horses\'?" Antony looked comically at him.');
lines.push('"You\'ll never forgive me, Bill," he said. "You\'ll never come');
lines.push('clue-hunting with me again."');
lines.push('"What do you mean?"');
lines.push('Antony sighed.');
lines.push('"It was a fake, Watson. I wanted you out of the way. I wanted to be');
lines.push('alone. I\'d guessed at my x, and I wanted to test it--to test it every');
lines.push('way, by everything we\'d discovered. I simply had to be alone just then.');
lines.push('So--" he smiled and added, "Well, I knew you wanted a drink."');
lines.push('"You are a devil," said Bill, staring at him. "And your interest when I');
lines.push('told you that a woman had been staying there--"');
lines.push('"Well, it was only polite to be interested when you\'d taken so much');
lines.push('trouble."');
lines.push('"You brute! You--you Sherlock! And then you keep trying to steal my');
lines.push('matches. Well, go on."');
lines.push('"That\'s all. My x fitted."');
lines.push('"Did you guess Miss Norris and all that?"');
lines.push('"Well, not quite. I didn\'t realize that Cayley had worked for it from');
lines.push('the beginning--had put Miss Norris up to frightening Mark. I thought');
lines.push('he\'d just seized the opportunity."');
lines.push('Bill was silent for a long time. Then, puffing at his pipe, he said');
lines.push('slowly, "Has Cayley shot himself?"');
lines.push('Antony shrugged his shoulders.');
lines.push('"Poor devil," said Bill. "It was decent of you to give him a chance. I\'m');
lines.push('glad you did."');
lines.push('"I couldn\'t help liking Cayley in a kind of way, you know."');
lines.push('"He\'s a clever devil. If you hadn\'t turned up just when you did, he');
lines.push('would never have been found out."');
lines.push('"I wonder. It was ingenious, but it\'s often the ingenious thing which');
lines.push('gets found out. The awkward thing from Cayley\'s point of view was that,');
lines.push('though Mark was missing, neither he nor his body could ever be found.');
lines.push('Well, that doesn\'t often happen with a missing man. He generally gets');
lines.push('discovered in the end; a professional criminal; perhaps not--but an');
lines.push('amateur like Mark! He might have kept the secret of how he killed Mark,');
lines.push('but I think it would have become obvious sooner or later that he had');
lines.push('killed him."');
lines.push('"Yes, there\'s something in that.... Oh, just tell me one thing. Why did');
lines.push('Mark tell Miss Norbury about his imaginary brother?"');
lines.push('"That\'s puzzled me rather, too, Bill. It may be that he was just doing');
lines.push('the Othello business--painting himself black all over. I mean he may');
lines.push('have been so full of his appearance as Robert that he had almost got to');
lines.push('believe in Robert, and had to tell everybody. More likely, though, he');
lines.push('felt that, having told all of you at the house, he had better tell Miss');
lines.push('Norbury, in case she met one of you; in which case, if you mentioned the');
lines.push('approaching arrival of Robert, she might say, \'Oh, I\'m certain he has');
lines.push('no brother; he would have told me if he had,\' and so spoil his joke.');
lines.push('Possibly, too, Cayley put him on to it; Cayley obviously wanted as many');
lines.push('people as possible to know about Robert."');
lines.push('"Are you going to tell the police?"');
lines.push('"Yes, I suppose they\'ll have to know. Cayley may have left another');
lines.push('confession. I hope he won\'t give me away; you see, I\'ve been a sort of');
lines.push('accessory since yesterday evening. And I must go and see Miss Norbury."');
lines.push('"I asked," explained Bill, "because I was wondering what I should say');
lines.push('to--to Betty. Miss Calladine. You see, she\'s bound to ask."');
lines.push('"Perhaps you won\'t see her again for a long, long time," said Antony');
lines.push('sadly.');
lines.push('"As a matter of fact, I happen to know that she will be at the');
lines.push('Barringtons. And I go up there to-morrow."');
lines.push('"Well, you had better tell her. You\'re obviously longing to. Only don\'t');
lines.push('let her say anything for a day or two. I\'ll write to you."');
lines.push('"Righto!"');
lines.push('Antony knocked the ashes out of his pipe and got up.');
lines.push('"The Barringtons," he said. "Large party?"');
lines.push('"Fairly, I think."');
lines.push('Antony smiled at his friend.');
lines.push('"Yes. Well, if any of \'em should happen to be murdered, you might send');
lines.push('for me. I\'m just getting into the swing of it."');
